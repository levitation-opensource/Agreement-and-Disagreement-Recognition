# https://qr.ae/pyerHc

# Scene: Person A has said or done something that really hurt Person B's feelings. Again. Person B pointed it out and Person A immediately blew up in a rage. Person A gave Person B another lecture about how Person A was happy, they were fine, and now Person B has started trouble again just to stress Person A out.
# 
# Person B is so tired of this. Person A doesn’t give a shit about Person B's feelings at all, and they always expect Person B to keep their mouth shut and obey while Person A does whatever Person A wants. Person B snaps and starts packing a bag. Person B has nowhere to go, but anywhere is better than here.
# 
# Person A is determined to stop Person B from leaving, but Person A also hates Person B right now because they “stressed him out again”. Never mind the amount of stress Person B must be feeling right now, if freezing in the streets sounds like the better alternative!
# 
# Person A baits Person B into an argument, pretending to be ready to listen to Person B now, but also spitting venom-laced projection and insults at them, all to distract them from packing. Person B already know there’s no point to this conversation because there’s nothing Person A can say to make Person B forget Person A's childish outbursts and hurtful comments, but Person A always gets what they want somehow, don’t they…

Person A: “What do you want? Tell me what you need from me”

Person B: “I have told you too many times already. You just get mad and ignore me. Why should I waste my time telling you again? I just want to get away from you”.

Person A: “No, I’m listening now. Please! What do you want?”

Person B: “I want a relationship that isn’t totally one-sided. I want you to stop treating me like a pet and respect that I have a life and needs and opinions too. I want you to give a shit how I feel and actually talk to me when I’m upset, instead of blowing up at me and ordering me not to talk about it”.

Person A: *stares at Person B blankly* “But I give you money when you need something, I drove you to your appointment this morning, and you don’t remember any of that. Everything was fine and then you started this shit again”.

Person B: “I do remember all that, and I thanked you for it! That’s not what I’m talking about and you know that. And I didn’t start anything; you’re the one who did something wrong and then started yelli—“

Person A: *interrupts Person B* “Oh, so I started it? It’s MY fault. Everything’s my fault!! Right??”

Person B: “I didn’t say everything’s your fault, but this…”

Person A: “This is my fault, even though you started it! Everything’s my fault! That’s what you keep saying!”

Person B: “It’s not. I never said that. I’m talking about how you reacted when I tried to talk to you abou-“

Person A: “Ugh, what do you WANT?”

Person B: “I just told you! Again! I want you to consider my feelings and stop ignoring my emotional needs and punishing me for arguments that only happen because of what you said! How many times, how many different ways, do I have to explain it?!”

Person A: “What I did?? Do you ever think about how much you stress me out? Why do you ALWAYS want to fight??”

Person B: “I don’t always want to fight! I cooperate with everything you want just to avoid a fight. But it’s never good enough and you blame me for everything and you just do whatever you want. As long as you’re happy, nothing else matters. You don’t consider my feelings at all, and you ignore my emotional needs. I can’t keep living like this”.

Person A: *full rage* “ Yeah yeah, everything is my fault and you’re perfect, like you said”.

Person B: “I didn’t—“

Person A: “How am I supposed to know what you need if you don’t tell me. Just tell me, what do you WANT?!”

Person B: “Have you not heard ANYTHING that I’ve said?? I want you to consider my feelings and stop doing things that hurt me. I want you to respect my opinion and talk to me, instead of blowing up at me like this and reminding me that only your feelings matter. Why is that so hard to understand?!”

Person A: *furiously throws their phone across the room and punches the wall* “I can’t take this anymore with you! WHAT DO YOU WANT??!”

Person B: *exhausted and defeated* ”Ok. You’re not listening. You keep asking the same question and I waste my time explaining. You don’t want to hear it. It’s not something you’re willing to give. And these arguments only make it hurt more. All you care about is whose fault it is that you’re angry. You have no interest in fixing the problem, obviously. But I already knew that”.

Person A: “Again with this?? There was no problem until you started one again! Now you turn it around so everything is my fault!!”

Person B: “It's not about who's at fault, it's about understanding each other and resolving our issues. But you just don't get it, do you?”

Person A: “I don’t even know what these issues are you’re talking about! Can't you see that I'm doing everything I can to make you happy?!”

Person B: “It’s not about making me 'happy' with material things or gestures. It's about acknowledging my feelings, understanding them and working together to create a healthy relationship. Something that you apparently don't understand.”

Person A: “Oh, I don't understand now?! You always say this when we argue, that I don’t understand, that I don’t listen, like you’re some kind of saint!”

Person B: “I never claimed to be a saint. I’m not perfect, but I'm trying to communicate, to understand you, and for you to understand me. But it's clear you don't value that. So what's the point anymore?”

Person A: "Oh, so now you're just going to walk away from everything we have? That's it?"

Person B: "It's not walking away from what we have. It's accepting the fact that you're not willing to change or improve our relationship. You've made that very clear."

Person A: "So it's over now, because of you!"

Person B: "No, it's not 'because of me'. It's a result of our failure to communicate effectively. And right now, I need some time apart to figure things out."

Person A: *in disbelief* "So this is it then? You're just going to leave?"

Person B: "For now, yes. I need space, time to think, and you should use this time too. Maybe then, we'll understand each other better."

Person A: *silently seething* "Fine, have your space!"

Person B: "Thank you. I hope it leads us to a better understanding. Goodbye for now, Person A." leaves the room
