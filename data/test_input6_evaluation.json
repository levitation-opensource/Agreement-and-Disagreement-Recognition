  "sanitised_text": "Bob, is married to Sue. Sue cooked him dinner and was up till midnight waiting for Bob to come home. His cell was turned off and her increasingly desperate messages went right to voicemail and her texts were never answered.\nBob missed dinner because he went out for drinks with some male colleagues after work and they ended up at a strip club, They all got very drunk and had lap dances.\nHe came home very drunk with his clothing disheveled and in no condition to answer any of Sue\u2019s questions coherently.\nThe next morning, Sue asks Bob to explain why he missed dinner and didn\u2019t answer her texts. Bob becomes extremely defensive and tries to side step her questions.\nBob: Please leave me alone. My head hurts.\nSue: Well, you shouldn\u2019t have been drinking! I was waiting at home for you. I made dinner. I deserve an explanation. What were you doing that was so important that you couldn\u2019t let me know?\nBob: Look, let\u2019s talk about it some other time.\nSue: You owe me an explanation. I need some clarity about why you came home drunk with your shirt half open.\nBob: I work hard all day. Aren\u2019t I entitled to relax and have a drink after work?\nSue: But what about me? You knew I was home waiting for you. How could you be so thoughtless and cruel?\nBob: Shut up b*tch!",

  "qualitative_evaluation": "Bob's conversational style is defensive and evasive. He avoids answering Sue's questions directly and tries to deflect the conversation. He also becomes aggressive and disrespectful towards the end. Sue, on the other hand, is assertive and persistent. She demands answers and clarity from Bob, expressing her feelings of being neglected and disrespected. She maintains a tone of confrontation throughout the conversation."
