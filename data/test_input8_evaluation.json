  "qualitative_evaluation": "Person A's conversational style is inquisitive and emotional. They ask questions to understand the situation and express their feelings through their words and actions. They show confusion, hope, and panic at different points in the conversation. On the other hand, Person B's style is more detached and matter-of-fact. They provide straightforward answers without showing much emotion or empathy towards Person A's feelings. They also maintain silence at certain points, which adds to their aloof demeanor."
