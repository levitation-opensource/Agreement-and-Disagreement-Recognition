  "qualitative_evaluation": "Person A's conversational style is inquisitive and emotional. They ask questions to understand the situation and express their feelings through their reactions. They also show signs of panic and confusion when they learn about the kittens' fate. On the other hand, Person B's style is more detached and nonchalant. They respond to Person A's questions with short, direct statements and show little emotional reaction to the situation. They also maintain silence at times, which adds to their aloof demeanor."
