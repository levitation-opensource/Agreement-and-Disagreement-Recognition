  "qualitative_evaluation": "Person A's conversational style is inquisitive and emotional. They ask questions to understand the situation and express their feelings through their tone and reactions. They are also hopeful and concerned about the kittens' wellbeing. \n\nPerson B's style is more detached and nonchalant. They provide straightforward answers without much emotional involvement. They also display a certain level of indifference towards Person A's emotional reactions, and their responses are brief and to the point."
