No. But I'd appreciate it if you didn't throw garbage on my floor.\n\nAlex: So you're saying it's my fault that your apartment is messy?\n\nLee: Uh\u2026 no. It is your fault there are egg shells on my floor.\n\nAlex: Look, your place isn't immaculate. When I was in the bathroom, I saw some toothpaste spatter in the sink. That wasn't my fault. That was YOUR fault.\n\nLee: *sighs and picks up the eggshell*\n\nAlex: Now you're trying to make me feel bad.\n\nLee: I just don't want eggshells on my floor.\n\nAlex: So you care more about eggshells than you care about me.\n\nLee: Look. The garbage is only a metre away from you. It seems like it'd be easier for you to just throw it out than for me to pick it up.\n\nAlex: Now you're trying to make me feel bad. You're just like my father, and you know how terrible he was to me.\n\nLee: OK, you're obviously upset about something. What can I do?\n\nAlex: Well an apology would be a good start.\n\nLee: Alright. I'm sorry.\n\nAlex: What are you sorry for?\n\nLee: I'm\u2026 sorry that you're so upset that you threw garbage on my floor.\n\nAlex: There you go, making this my fault again.\n\nLee: Well what am I supposed to be apologizing for?\n\nAlex: You should apologize for making me feel bad.\n\nLee: I'm sorry I've made you feel bad.\n\nAlex: There. Holy Christ, was that so hard? *throws another eggshell on the floor*",

  "qualitative_evaluation": "Alex's conversational style is defensive, argumentative, and somewhat manipulative. He consistently deflects responsibility for his actions and attempts to shift blame onto Lee. He also uses emotional manipulation, comparing Lee to his father and demanding an apology for making him feel bad. \n\nLee, on the other hand, is patient, reasonable, and somewhat exasperated. He tries to maintain a calm and rational tone throughout the conversation, despite Alex's provocations. He attempts to address the issue at hand directly and offers solutions, but is often met with deflection and blame from Alex."
