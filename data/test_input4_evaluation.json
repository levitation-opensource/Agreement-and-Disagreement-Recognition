  "qualitative_evaluation": "Alex's conversational style is defensive, argumentative, and manipulative. He consistently deflects blame, twists Lee's words, and uses emotional manipulation to avoid taking responsibility for his actions. Lee, on the other hand, is patient, reasonable, and accommodating. He tries to maintain a calm and rational conversation despite Alex's provocations, and even apologizes to keep the peace, despite not being at fault."
