<div class="entities" style="line-height: 2.5; direction: ltr">A living-room on the first floor of a four-storeyed house in a gloomy and unfashionable quarter of London. The latter part of the nineteenth century.</br></br>Late afternoon</br></br>The room is furnished in all the heavily draped and dingy profusion of the period and yet, amidst this abundance of paraphernalia, an air is breathed of poverty, wretchedness and age</br></br>There is a fireplace R with a mirror over it and a vase on the mantelpiece.</br></br>There is a door us of the fireplace leading to a little room, a window in the back wall c, with blinds and curtains, and a door UL which leads to a passage and the (unseen) stairs, with a bell-cord hanging beside it. Also UL is a cupboard. There is a settee R, DS of the fireplace, an armchair in front of the fire with a little stool beside it, and a table c with books and other items on it and chairs beneath it. There is a bureau against the wall DL WITH a Bible on it, a chair in front of it and a lamp us of it. Another chair DL has Mr Manningham's hat and coat on it. There is another little table with a bottle of medicine upon it and a hook on the wall US where a picture has obviously been hanging until recently. The room's general lighting is by means of two incandescent gas mantles to either side of the fireplace</br></br>Rather terrifying darkness of the late afternoon - the zero hour, as it were, before the feeble dawn of gaslight and tea. Infront of the fire, in an armchair, Mr Manningham is stretched out and sleeping heavily, a newspaper beside him. He is tall, good-looking, about forty-five.</br></br>He is heavily moustached and whiskered. He has a fine figure, and is perhaps a little too well-dressed. His manner is suave and authoritative, with a touch of mystery and bitterness. Mrs Manningham is sitting sewing on the settee, a sewing-box beside her. She is about thirty-four. She has been good-looking, almost a beauty - but now she has a haggard, wan, frightened air, with rings under her eyes, which tell of sleepless nights and worse</br></br>Pause</br></br>From the street below, in the distance, can be heard the intermittent jingling of a muffin-man ringing his bell. Mrs Manningham listens to this sound for a few moments, furtively and indecisively, almost as though she isfrightened even of this. She rustles quickly over to the window and looks down into the street, then to the bell-cord by the door, which she pulls, then back to her sewing, which she gathers up and puts into the box, at the same time taking a purse from the box</br></br>There is a knock at the door, and Elizabeth, the cook and housekeeper, enters.</br></br>She is a stout, amiable, subservient woman of about fifty</br></br>Mrs Manningham signals that her husband is asleep then goes over and whispers to Elizabeth at the door, giving her some money from the purse</br></br>Elizabeth exits</br></br>Mr Manningham's eyes open but his position does not change a fraction of an inch</br></br>Mr Manningham: What are you doing, Bella?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Nothing, dear... (She moves back to the window to look out) Don't wake yourself.</br></br>There is a pause. She goes to her sewing-box, replaces the purse in it and puts the box away, then moves to the window again</br></br>Mr Manningham: (closing his eyes again) What are you doing, Bella? Come here ...</br></br>Mrs Manningham hesitates then moves to her husband</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Only for tea, my dear. Muffins - for tea ... (She takes his hand)</br></br>Mr Manningham: Muffins ... Eh ... ?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes, dear ... He only comes so seldom ... I thought I might surprise you.</br></br>Mr Manningham: Why are you so apprehensive, Bella? I was not about to reproach you.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (nervously releasing his hand) No, dear. I know you weren't. (She moves back to the window)</br></br>Mr Manningham: This fire's in ashes. Ring the bell, will you, Bella dear, please?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes ... (She moves towards the bell, but stops) Is it merely to put coal on, my dear? I can do that.</br></br>Mr Manningham:

</br></br>Mrs Manningham: But, dear - Lizzie's out in the street. Let me do it. I can do it so easily. (She moves over to the fireplace)</br></br>Mr Manningham: (stopping her with an outstretched hand) No, no, no, no, no ... Where's the girl? Let the girl come up if Lizzie's out.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: But, my dear - -</br></br>Mr Manningham:

</br></br>Mrs Manningham does not answer. There is a pause</br></br>Mr Manningham: Go on. Answer me. What do you suppose servants are for?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (shamefacedly, and scarcely audibly, merely dutifully feeding him) To serve us, I suppose, Jack ...</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Precisely. Then why - - ?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: But I think we should consider them a little, that's all.</br></br>Mr Manningham: Consider them? There's your extraordinary confusion of the mind again. You speak as though they work for no consideration. I happen to consider Elizabeth to the tune of sixteen pounds per annum. And the girl ten. Twenty-six pounds a year all told. And if that is not consideration of the most acute and lively kind, I should like to know what is.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes, Jack. I expect you are right.</br></br>Mr Manningham: I have no doubt of it, my dear. It's sheer weak mindedness to think otherwise. (Pause) What's the weather doing? Is it still as yellow?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes, it seems to be denser than ever. Shall you be going out in this, Jack dear?</br></br>Mr Manningham: Oh - I expect so. Unless it gets very much worse after tea.</br></br>There is a knock at the door. Mrs Manningham hesitates. There is another knock</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Come in.</br></br>Nancy, the maid, enters. She is a self-conscious, pretty, cheeky girl of nineteen</br></br>Mrs Manningham hesitates to tell Nancy why she rang the bell. Nancy looks at the Manninghams</br></br>Nancy: Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought the bell rang ...</br></br>Mr Manningham: Yes, we rang the bell, Nancy... (Pause) Go on, my dear, tell her why we rang the bell.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Oh ... Yes... We want some coal on the fire, Nancy, please.</br></br>Nancy looks impudently at Mrs Manningham, and then, with a little smile and toss of the head, goes over and puts coal on the fire</br></br>Mr Manningham: (after a pause) And you might as well light the gas, Nancy. This darkness in the afternoon is getting beyond endurance.</br></br>Nancy: Yes, sir. (She gets the matches, with another barely discernible little smile, and lights the two incandescent mantles during the following)</br></br>Mr Manningham rises, stretches himself, and stands warming his legs in front of the fire. He watches Nancy as she lights the second mantle</br></br>Mr Manningham:

That's not true, either. I wonder what mysterious lotions you've been employing to enhance your natural beauties.</br></br>Nancy: I'm quite natural, sir. I promise you.</br></br>During the following, Nancy moves to the window, lowers the blind and draws the curtains, then lights the lamp L</br></br>Mr Manningham: But you do it adroitly, I grant you that.

As though I'd do anything to my face, and ask for her assistance if I did.</br></br>Mr Manningham: But you seem to look upon the servants as our natural equals. So I treated her as one. (He picks up his paper and sits down on the settee) Besides, I was only trifling with her.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: It's strange that you can't see how you hurt me. That girl laughs at me enough already.</br></br>Mr Manningham: Laughs at you? What an idea. What makes you think she laughs at you?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Oh - I know she does in secret.

Because you have stayed in, and been kind to me. The other night when you stayed in and played cards with me, it was like the old days, and I went to bed feeling a normal, happy, healthy human being. And then, the day after, when you read your book to me, Jack, and we sat by the fire, I felt all my love for you coming back, then, Jack. And I slept that night like a child. All those ghastly dreads and terrible, terrible fears seemed to have vanished. And all just because you had given me your time, and taken me from brooding on myself in this house all day and night.</br></br>Mr Manningham:

Well - I daresay you're right. I must bear it in mind. Mr Manningham's taking me next week, you see.</br></br>Nancy: Oh yes? I hope you enjoy it. I'll bring out the muffins directly.</br></br>Nancy exits</br></br>Mrs Manningham puts out her tongue at Nancy.

Let her put that in her pipe and smoke it.</br></br>Mr Manningham: But what has she done?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Ah - you don't know her. She tries to torment and score off me all day long. You don't see these things. A man wouldn't. She thinks me a poor thing. And now she can suffer the news that you're taking me to the theatre.</br></br>Mr Manningham:

In fact, you may hardly believe it, but I even had an ambition to be an actor myself at one time.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: I can well believe it, dear. Come along to your tea now.</br></br>Mr Manningham: You know, Bella, that must be a very superb sensation. To take a part and lose yourself entirely in the character of someone else. I flatter myself I could have made an actor.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Why, of course, my dear. You were cut out for it. Anyone can see that.</br></br>Mr Manningham: (moving slowly L) No - do you think so - seriously? I always felt a faint tinge of regret.

Oh - you've made a great mistake.</br></br>Mr Manningham: (sitting to the R of the table) I wonder.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Then if you had been a famous actor, I should have had a free seat to come and watch you every night of my life. And then called for you at the stage door afterwards. Wouldn't that have been paradise?</br></br>Mr Manningham: A paradise of which you would soon tire, my dear. I have no doubt that after a few nights you would be staying at home again, just as you do now.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Oh no, I wouldn't. I should have to keep my eye on you for all the hussies that would be after you.</br></br>Mr Manningham: There would be hussies after me, would there? That is an added inducement, then.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes - I know it, you wretch. But you wouldn't escape me. (She lifts the cover of the muffin dish and prepares muffins during the following) They look delicious. Aren't you glad I thought of them? Here's some salt. You want heaps of it. Oh, Jack dear, you must forgive me chattering on like this, but I'm feeling so happy.</br></br>Mr Manningham: I can see that, my dear.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: I'm being taken to the play, you see.

She searches elsewhere in the room, holding her head and crying. At last she breaks down into sobbing upon the settee. Pause. She rises, goes to the little table, and takes some medicine. This is obviously incredibly nasty, and almost chokes her. She staggers. She goes over to the lamp and turns it down very low. She then moves back to the settee</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (whispering) God have mercy on me - God have mercy on me! (She puts up her feet and lies back, exhausted.

He is over sixty - greying, short, wiry, active, brusque, friendly, overbearing. He completely dominates the scene from his entrance</br></br>Rough: Thank you... Ah - good evening. (He moves to Mrs Manningham) Mrs Manningham, I believe ... How are you, Mrs Manningham?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (shaking hands with Rough but not letting go of his hand) How do you do. I'm very much afraid ...</br></br>Rough: You're very much afraid you don't know me from Adam? That's about the root of the matter, isn't it?</br></br>Elizabeth exits, closing the door</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Oh, no - it's not that - but no doubt you have come to see my husband?</br></br>Rough: (still holding her hand and looking at her appraisingly) Oh. no! You couldn't be further out. On the contrary, I have chosen this precise moment to call when I knew your husband was out. May I take off my things and sit down?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Why, yes. I suppose you may.</br></br>Rough: You're a good deal younger and more attractive than I thought, you know. But you're looking very pale. Have you been crying?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Really - I'm afraid I don't understand at all.</br></br>Rough: You will do so, madam, very shortly. (He moves L and removes his scarf during the following) You're the lady who's going off her head, aren't you?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (moving towards him) What made you say that? Who are you? What have you come to talk about?</br></br>Rough: (taking off his coat and putting it on a chair) Well, of one thing you can be certain. I have not come to talk about the weather. Though that indeed merits a world of comment at the moment. But you're running away with things, Mrs Manningham, and asking me a good deal I can't answer at once. Instead of that, I am going to ask you a question or two ... Now, please, will you come here and give me your hands?</br></br>There is a pause. She obeys</br></br>Rough: Now, Mrs Manningham, I want you to take a good look at me, and see if you are not looking at someone to whom you can give your trust. I am a perfect stranger to you, and you can read little in my face besides that. But I can read a great deal in yours.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (after a pause) What? What can you read in mine?</br></br>Rough: Why, madam. I can read the tokens of one who has travelled a very long way upon the path of sorrow and doubt - and will have, I fear, to travel a little further before she comes to the end. But I fancy she is coming towards the end, for all that. Come now. are you going to trust me, and listen to me? I'm old enough to be your grandfather.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (after a pause) Who are you? God knows I need help.</br></br>Rough: I very much doubt whether God knows anything of the sort, Mrs Manningham. Had he done so I believe he would have come to your aid before this. But I am here, and so you must give me your faith.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Who are you? Are you a doctor?</br></br>Rough: Nothing so learned, ma'am. Just a plain police detective.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Police detective?</br></br>Rough: Yes. Or was ten years ago. At any rate, still detective enough to see that you've been interrupted in your tea. Couldn't you start again, and let me have a cup?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Why, yes - yes. I will give you a cup. It only wants water. (She busies her self with hot water, cup, teapot, etcetera, throughout the ensuing conversation)</br></br>Rough: (fetching a chair and bringing it to the table) You never heard of the celebrated Sergeant Rough, madam? Sergeant Rough, who solved the Claudesley Diamond Case - Sergeant Rough, who hunted down the Camberwell Dogs - Sergeant Rough, who brought Sandham himself to justice ... (He puts his hand on the back of the chair, and looks at her) Or were all such sensations before your time?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Sandham? Why, yes, I have heard of Sandham - the murderer, the throttler.</br></br>Rough: Yes, madam, Sandham the Throttler. And you are now looking at the man who gave Sandham to the man who throttled him. And that was the common hangman. In fact, Mrs Manningham, you have in front of you one who was quite a personage in his day - believe it or not.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: I quite believe it. Won't you sit down? I'm afraid it won' t be very hot.</br></br>Rough: Thank you... How long have you been married, Mrs Manningham?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Seven years - and a little.</br></br>Rough: Where have you lived during all that time, Mrs Manningham?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (putting milk in Rough's cup and passing it to him) Why ... First we went abroad - then we lived in Yorkshire, and then six months ago my husband took this house.</br></br>Rough: (taking the cup) Thank you ... And does your husband always leave you alone like this in the evenings?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes. He goes to his club, I believe, and does business.</br></br>Rough: (stirring his tea; thoughtfully) So you believe.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes ...</br></br>Rough: And does your husband give you a free run of the whole house while he's out?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes ... Well, no... Not the top floor. Why do you ask?</br></br>Rough: Ah - not the top floor ...</br></br>Mrs Manningham: No... no... Will you have some sugar? What were you saying? (She sits, bending over eagerly to answer his questions)</br></br>Rough: Before I go any further, Mrs Manningham, I must tell you there's a leakage in this household. You have a maid called Nancy?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes ... Yes...</br></br>Rough: And Nancy walks out of an evening with a young man named Booker in my employ. I only live a few streets away from you, you know.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Oh, yes?</br></br>Rough: Well, there is hardly anything which goes on in this house which is not described in detail to Booker, and from that quarter it reaches me.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: I knew it! I knew she talked. Now I know it, she shall be dismissed.</br></br>Rough: Oh, no - no such retribution is going to overtake her at the moment, Mrs Manningham. In fact, I fancy you are going to be heavily in debt to your maid, Nancy. If it were not for her indiscretions I should not be here now, should I?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: What do you mean? What is this mystery? You must not keep me in the dark. What is it?</br></br>Rough: I'm afraid I shall have to keep you in the dark for a little, Mrs Manningham, as I am still quite far down in the dark myself. Can I have another lump of sugar in this?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes. (She passes the sugar bowl to him)</br></br>Rough: Thank you. We were talking about the top floor. (Helping himself to several lumps) There is a bedroom above this, and above that again is the top floor? Is that right?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes.</br></br>Rough: Now - have you ever been up to that top floor?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: No. Never ... It's shut up. My husband has forbidden it. No-one goes up there.</br></br>Rough: Not even a servant to dust.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: No.</br></br>Rough: Rather funny?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (after a pause) Yes. (Pause) Yes, indeed ...</br></br>Rough: Yes. Now, Mrs Manningham, to ask a personal question: when did you first get the notion into your head that your reason was playing you tricks?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (after a pause) How did you know?</br></br>Rough: Never mind how I know. How did it begin?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: I always had that dread. My mother died insane, when she was quite young. When she was my age. But only in the last six months, in this house - things began to happen - -</br></br>Rough: Which are driving you mad with fear?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes. Which are driving me mad with fear.</br></br>Rough: Is it the house itself you fear, Mrs Manningham?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes. I suppose it is. I hate the house. I always did.</br></br>Rough: And has the top floor got anything to do with it?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes, yes, it has. How did you know? That's how all this dreadful horror began.</br></br>Rough: Ah - now you interest me beyond measure. Do tell me about the top floor.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: I don't know what to say. It all sounds incredible... It's when I'm alone at night. I get the idea that - somebody's walking about up there ... (Shepoints up) Up there ... At night, when my husband's out - I hear noises, from my bedroom, but I'm too afraid to go up ...</br></br>Rough: Have you told your husband about this?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: No. I'm afraid to. He gets angry. He says I imagine things which don't exist.</br></br>Rough: It never struck you, did it, that it might be your own husband walking about up there?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes - that is what I thought - but I thought I must be mad. Tell me how you knew.</br></br>Rough:

</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (rising and going towards the fireplace) It's true, then! I knew it. I knew it! When he leaves this house he comes back. He comes back and walks up there above - up and down - up and down. He comes back like a ghost. How does he get up there?</br></br>Rough: (rising and moving to Mrs Manningham) That's what we're going to find out, Mrs Manningham. But there are such commonplace resources as roofs and fire escapes, you know.

</br></br>Mrs Manningham: It was the light - the gaslight ... It went down and it went up ... Oh, thank God I can tell this to someone at last. I don't know who you are, but I must tell you.</br></br>Rough: Now try to keep calm. You can tell me just as well sitting down, can't you? Won't you sit down?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes ... yes. (She sits down on the settee)</br></br>Rough: (moving a small chair and sitting near her) The light, did you say? Did you see a light from a window?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: No. In this house, I can tell everything by the light of the gas. You see that mantle there? Now it's burning full. But if an extra light went on in the kitchen, or someone lit it in the bedroom, then this one would sink down. It's the same all over the house.</br></br>Rough: Yes - yes - that's just a question of insufficient pressure, and it's the same in mine. But go on, please.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Every night, after he goes out, I find myself waiting for something. Then all at once I look round the room and see that the light is slowly going down. At first I tried not to notice it, but after a time it began to get on my nerves. I would go all over the house to see if anyone had put on an extra light, but they never had. It's always the same time - about ten minutes after he goes out. That's what made me think that somehow he had come back and that it was he who was walking about up there. I go up to the bedroom but I daren't stay there because I hear noises overhead. I want to scream and run out of the house. I sit here for hours, terrified, waiting for him to come back, and I always know when he's coming again. Suddenly the light goes up again and ten minutes afterwards I hear his key in the lock downstairs, and he's back again.</br></br>Rough:

</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Far-reaching? How?</br></br>Rough: Well, let's leave it for the moment. Tell me, that is not the only cause, is it, which has lately given you reason to doubt your sanity? Has anything else been happening? Don't be afraid to tell me.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes, there are other things. I hardly dare speak of them. It has been going on for so long. This business of the gas has only brought it to a head. It seems that my mind and memory are beginning to play me tricks.</br></br>Rough: Tricks? What sort of tricks? When?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Incessantly - but more and more of late. He gives me things to look after, and when he asks for them they are gone, and can never be found. Then he misses his rings, or his studs, or his razors, and I will hunt the place for them, and he will find them lying hidden at the bottom of my work-box. Twice the door of that room was found locked with the key vanished. That was also found at the bottom of my box. Only today, before you came, that picture had been taken from the wall and hidden. Who could have done it but myself? I try to remember. I break my heart trying to remember. But I can't. Oh, and then there was that terrible business about the dog ...</br></br>Rough: The dog?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: We have a little dog. A few weeks ago, it was found with its paw hurt... He believes - oh God, how can I tell you what he believes - that I had hurt the dog. He does not let the dog near me now. He keeps it in the kitchen and I am not allowed to see it! I begin to doubt, don't you see? I begin to believe I imagine everything. Perhaps I do. Are you here? Is this a dream, too? Who are you? I'm afraid they are going to lock me up.</br></br>Rough:

He makes me take it. It does me no good, and I hate it. How can medicine help a mind that's ill?</br></br>Rough: Oh - but mine'san exceptional medicine. I have some with me now. You must try it.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: What medicine is it?</br></br>Rough: You shall sample it and see. (He rises and goes over to his coat) You see, it has been employed by humanity, for several ages, for the purpose of the instantaneous removal of dark fears and doubt. That seems to fit you. doesn't it?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: The removal of doubt. How could a medicine effect that?</br></br>Rough: Ah - that we don'tknow.The fact remains that it does. Here we are. (He produces a bottle of whisky) You see, it comes from Scotland. Now, madam, have you such a thing handy as two glasses or two cups?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Why - are you having some, too?</br></br>Rough: Oh yes. In fact, I am having some above all things. We could use these cups, if you like.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: No. I will get you ... (She goes to the cupboard and brings out two glasses)</br></br>Rough: Ah ... Thank you - the very thing. Now we shan't be long.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: What is it? I so dislike medicine. What does it taste like?</br></br>Rough: Delicious! Something between ambrosia and methylated spirits.

 Now for some water... All right, this will do. (He picks up the jug and pours water into Mrs Manningham's glass) There!

</br></br>Mrs Manningham: An old lady years ago? What has she to do with me?</br></br>Rough: A great deal, I fancy, if you will follow me patiently. Her name was Barlow - Alice Barlow, and she was an old lady of great wealth, and decided eccentricities. In fact, her principal mania in life was the protection of cabmen. You may think that an extraordinary hobby, but in her odd way she did a lot of good. She provided these men with shelters, clothing, pensions, and so forth, and that was her little contribution to the sum of the world's happiness, or rather her little stand against the sum of the world's pain. There is a great deal of pain in this world, Mrs Manningham, you know. Well, it was not my privilege to know her, but it was my duty, on just one occasion, to see her. That was when her throat was cut open, and she lay dead on the floor of her own house.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Oh, how horrible! Do you mean she was murdered?</br></br>Rough:

    Yes. She was murdered. I was only a comparatively young officer at the time, but it made an extremely horrible, in fact I may say lasting, impression on me.

 The murderer was never discovered but the motive was obvious enough. The Barlow Rubies had been inherited by her, and it was well known that she kept them, without any proper precautions, in her bedroom on an upper floor. She lived alone except for a deaf servant in the basement. Well, for that she paid the penalty of her life.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: But what - - ?</br></br>Rough: There were some sensational features about the case. The man seemed to have got in at about ten at night and stayed till dawn. Apart, presumably, from the jewels, there were only a few trinkets taken, but the whole house had been turned upside down, and in the upper room every single thing was flung about, or torn open. Even the cushions of the chairs were ripped up with his bloody knife, and the police decided that it must have been a revengeful maniac as well as a robber. I had other theories but I was a nobody then, and not in charge of the case.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: What were your theories?</br></br>Rough: Well, it seemed to me, from all that I gathered here and there, that the old lady might have been an eccentric, but that she was by no means a fool. It seemed to me that she might have been one too clever for that man. We presume he killed her to silence her, but what then? What if she had not been so careless? What if she had got those jewels hidden away in some inconceivably cunning place, in the walls, floored down, bricked in, maybe? What if the only person who could tell him where they were was lying dead on the floor! Would not that account, Mrs Manningham, for all the strange confusion in which the place was found. Can't you picture him. Mrs Manningham, searching through the night, ransacking the place, hour after hour, growing more and more desperate, until at last the dawn comes and he has to slink out into the pale street, the blood and wreckage of the night behind. And the deaf servant down in the basement sleeping like a dog through it all.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Oh, how horrible! How horrible indeed. And was the man ever found?</br></br>Rough: No, Mrs Manningham, the man was never found. Nor has the Barlow jewellery ever come to light.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Then perhaps he found it after all. and may be alive today.</br></br>Rough: I think he is almost certainly alive today, but I don't believe he found what he wanted. That is, if my theory is right.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Then the jewels may still be where the old lady hid them?</br></br>Rough: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    Indeed, Mrs Manningham, if my theory is right, the jewels must still be where she hid them, but then, of course, it was only a theory and that formed in quite a young man, long enough ago.

     The official conclusion was quite otherwise. The police, naturally and quite excusably presumed that the murderer had got them, and there was no re-opening of matters in those days. Soon enough the public forgot about it. I forgot about it myself. But it would be funny, wouldn't it, Mrs Manningham, if after all these years I should turn out to be right.

    Ah, that is the whole question, Mrs Manningham. What, indeed? What has the obscure murder of an old lady twenty years ago to do with an attractive, though I am afraid at present somewhat pale and wan young lady in this house, who believes she is going out of her mind, and watches the gaslight going up and down when her husband is out at night? Well, I believe there is a link, however remote, wild and strange it may be, and that is why I am here.

</br></br>Mrs Manningham: It's all so confusing.

Yes. Possibly. But how - - ?</br></br>Rough: Can you conceive that he may have waited years - five years, ten years, fifteen years, twenty years even - time in which he may have done many things: gone abroad, got married even, until at last his chance came to resume the search begun on that terrible night? You don't follow where I am leading at all, do you, Mrs Manningham?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Follow you? Yes, I think so.</br></br>Rough: You know, Mrs Manningham, of the old theory that the criminal always returns to the scene of his crime. Ah, yes, but in this case there is something more than morbid compulsion. There is treasure there to be unearthed if only he can search again, search methodically, without fear of interruption, without causing suspicion. And how would he do that?

Twenty years ago Alice Barlow lay dead in this room. Twenty years ago the man who murdered her ransacked this house - below and above - but could not find what he sought. What if he is still searching, Mrs Manningham? What if he is up there - still searching?

Most of that was left to me.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Well?</br></br>Rough: Well, amongst all the acquaintances and relatives, nephews and nieces, et cetera, that I interviewed, there happened to be a young man by the name of Sydney Power. I suppose you have never heard that name at all, have you?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Power?</br></br>Rough: Yes. Sydney Power. It conveys nothing to you?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Sydney Power. No ...</br></br>Rough: Well, he was a kind of distant cousin apparently much attached to the old lady, and even assisting her in her good works. The only thing was that I remembered his face. Well. I saw that face again about five weeks ago. It took me a whole day to discover where I had seen it before, but I remembered it at last.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Well - what of it? What if you did remember him?</br></br>Rough: It was not so much my remembering Mr Sydney Power, Mrs Manningham. What startled me was the lady on his arm, and the locality in which I saw him.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Oh - who was the lady on his arm?</br></br>Rough: You were the lady on his arm, Mrs Manningham, and you were walking down this street.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: What are you saying? Do you mean you think my husband - my husband is this Mr Power?</br></br>Rough: Well, not exactly, for if my theories are right - -</br></br>Mrs Manningham: What are you saying? You stand there talking riddles. You are so cold. You are as heartless and cold as he is.</br></br>Rough: (moving to her) No, Mrs Manningham, I am not cold, and I am not talking riddles. I am just trying to preserve a cold and calculating tone, because you are up against the most awful moment in your life, and your whole future depends on what you are going to do in the next hour.

    You are not going out of your mind, Mrs Manningham, you are slowly, methodically, systematically being driven out of your mind. And why? Because you are married to a criminal maniac who is afraid you are beginning to know too much - a criminal maniac who steals back to his own house at night, still searching for something he could not find twenty years ago. Those are the facts, wild and incredible as they may seem. His name is no more Manningham than mine is. He is Sydney Power and he murdered Alice Barlow in this house. He changed his name, and he has waited all these years, until he found it safe to acquire this house in a legal way. He then acquired the empty house next door. Every night, for the last few weeks, he has entered that house from the back, climbed up on to its roof and come into this house by the skylight. I know that because I have seen him do it. You have watched the gaslight, and been aware of the same thing. He is up there now. Why he should employ this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting at what he wants, God himself only knows. For the same reason, perhaps, that he employs this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting rid of you: that is by slowly driving you mad and sending you into a lunatic asylum. Thank God you are not married to him, and that I have come here to save you from the workings of his wicked mind.

What the devil's this, then? I thought this was Nancy's afternoon off. Was it not arranged that I should come when Nancy was away?</br></br>Elizabeth: Yes, sir. But for some reason she's stayed on. I think she's got a young man, and I couldn't make her go, could I, sir? If I'd done that, I'd've - -</br></br>Rough: All right... all right. Then she was here when I came, and she knows I am here - is that it?</br></br>Elizabeth: Oh, no ... She was in the scullery when I answered the door, and I said it was a man who had come to the wrong house. She hasn't no idea, sir, and I'm - -</br></br>Rough: All right. All right. That's better news. But it means you can't entertain me in the kitchen. (He goes to the window) Now where are you going to hide me, Elizabeth? Make up your mind quickly, as time is getting rather short.</br></br>Elizabeth: I don't know, sir. Unless you go to the bedroom. Mine and Nancy's, I mean.</br></br>Rough: That sounds altogether entrancing! Shall we go there now?</br></br>Elizabeth: Yes, sir, but supposing Nancy went up there before she goes out?</br></br>Rough: You think of everything, Elizabeth, and you're a good soul. (He moves to the door UR) Where does this lead to. and what's the matter with this?</br></br>Elizabeth: It's where he dresses, where he keeps his clothes. Yes, sir. Go in there, sir. He won't see you there. There's a big wardrobe there, at the back.</br></br>Rough: (going again to the window and looking out briefly) Excuse me.</br></br>Rough exits into the room UR</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Oh, Elizabeth.</br></br>Elizabeth: It's all right, ma'am. Don't take on so. It'll be all right.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: I'm sure he ought to go.</br></br>Elizabeth: No, ma'am. He knows best. He's bound to know best.</br></br>Rough enters from the room UR</br></br>Rough: Perfect accommodation. (He goes to the window for another peep. He sees something) Yes, there he is. Now we really have got to hurry. Get off to bed, Mrs Manningham, quick. And you, Elizabeth, go to your room. You can't get downstairs in time. Hurry, please. Elizabeth, turn down that lamp. (He turns down the gaslights during the following)</br></br>Elizabeth turns down the lamp</br></br>Mrs Manningham: To bed? Am I to go to bed?</br></br>Rough: (really excited for the first time)

He looks over the landing. He comes back and listens in the doorway. He goes over to the window and peeps through the curtains. He comes again to the door UL and stands rigidly in the doorway, listening intently. After a pause there is the sound of the front door slamming. He stiffens. He still listens.

He comes in and shuts the door</br></br>The stage is almost completely dark now</br></br>There is a pause.Then Mr Manningham can be heard moving a chair. He reaches the gaslights, and turns them up. He looks around in a decidedly suspicious way. He takes off his gloves and looks at the tea things. He goes and rings the bell, whistling to himself. He takes off his hat and overcoat in a leisurely way, dusting his trousers</br></br>Elizabeth enters</br></br>Elizabeth: Did you ring, sir?</br></br>Mr Manningham: Yes, I did.</br></br>Mr Manningham, without saying why he has rung, places his hat and overcoat over a chair and then comes and stands with his back to the fireplace</br></br>Mr Manningham: Where is Mrs Manningham, Elizabeth?</br></br>Elizabeth: I think she's gone to bed, sir. I think she had a bad headache and went to bed.</br></br>Mr Manningham: Oh, indeed. And how long has the good lady been in bed, do you know?</br></br>Elizabeth: She went just a little while ago, sir - I think, sir - -</br></br>Mr Manningham: Oh. I see.

Just a little patience - a little adroitness in the use - -</br></br>The front door is heard to slam</br></br>Rough: What's that? Go and have a look, will you? We seem to be rather bothered this evening, don't we?</br></br>Mrs Manningham runs over to the window</br></br>Mrs Manningham: It's all right. It's only Nancy. I forgot.

And when she got there the cupboard was bare - (he picks up a piece of paper) and so the poor detective - -</br></br>Mrs Manningham: What is that in your hand? Let me see. Let me see. (She takes the piece of paper from him)</br></br>Rough: Just a bill, I fancy.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes. As you say. Just a bill. Just a grocer's bill. (Pause) You must forgive me if I doubted you at first, Inspector. You are right. He must be the wickedest man on earth.</br></br>Rough: Now I'm afraid you're one ahead of me, Mrs Manningham.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: This bill. This evening he went storming out of the house because he had given it to me, and it had disappeared. He threatened me with the mad-house if it did not come to light. I am beginning to understand, I think, at last.</br></br>Rough: Really now. (He takes the bill from her) Well, well, the essence of a good trick is its simplicity, isn't it?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Is there anything else there? What else is there? Yes, look, my watch! And my brooch - my brooch. (Shepicks up a watch and brooch from the drawer) Look at these. My God, look at these! (She pulls the drawer out of the bureau and takes it to the table)</br></br>Rough: These are your property also, then?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes. Both of them. This watch I lost a week ago - my brooch has been missing three months. And he said he would give me no more gifts because I lost them. He said that in my wickedness I hid them away. Oh, Inspector, you have indeed found treasure tonight.</br></br>Rough: (going to a drawer at the side of the bureau) Not very much at present, I'm afraid - at least not very much to the point. Ah, yes, this is locked</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (finding another bit of paper and reading it) One moment... One moment... (Still reading it, she sits down L of the table) This is from my cousin - my cousin - -</br></br>Rough: Is his correspondence with your relations very much to the point at the moment, Mrs Manningham?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: You don't understand. (Rapidly) You don't understand. When I was married I was cast off by all my relations. I have not seen any of them ever since I have been married. They did not approve my choice. I have longed to see them again more than anything else in the world. When we came to London - to this house, I wrote to them. I wrote to them twice. There was never any answer. Now I see why I had no answer. This letter is from my cousin.</br></br>Rough: Ah, yes, I see. Just another little - -</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Listen. Let me read you what he says. Let me read it to you. (Reading) &quot;Dear Cousin... All of us were overjoyed to hear from you again.&quot; Overjoyed, do you hear that? He goes on to say that his family are in Devonshire, that they have gone to the country. He says we must meet and recapture old times ... (She shows signs of emotion) He says that they all want to see me... He says he is sorry I have not been well - that I must go and stay with them - that they will give me ... that they will give me - their Devonshire cream to fatten my cheeks, and their fresh air to bring the sparkle back to my eyes... They will give me... (Breaking down) Dear heaven, they wanted me back! They wanted me back all the time! (She cries softly)</br></br>Rough: (moving to Mrs Manningham) Poor thing. Poor thing. You shall have your Devonshire cream, my dear, and you shall have your fresh air to bring the sparkle back into your eyes. Why, I can see a sparkle in them already. If you will be brave now, you will not have to wait so long. Are you going to be brave?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Thank you, Inspector, for bringing me this letter. What do you want me to do now?</br></br>Rough: Oh, just stand by for the moment, Mrs Manningham. Tell me. (Indicating the side drawer) This drawer here. Has it ever been open to your knowledge?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: No.</br></br>Rough: No? I suspected as much ... Yes. This is a tougher proposition, I'm afraid. (He goes to his overcoat and produces an iron instrument)</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (rising to stop him) What are you going to do? Are you going to force it?</br></br>Rough: If I possibly can. I don't know that - -</br></br>Mrs Manningham: But you must not do that. You mustn't. What shall I say when he comes back?</br></br>Rough:

Is there? ... Why didn't you tell me that?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Why - I only found it myself a little while ago.</br></br>Rough: Oh - really ... (He opens the bureau and takes out the brooch) Do you know, I have afeeling I have seen this somewhere before. Where is this inscription you speak of?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: It is a sort of trick. I only discovered it by accident. You pull the pin at the back out. It goes to the right, and then to the left. It opens out like a star.</br></br>Rough: (following thse instructions) Oh, yes ... Yes ... Ah ... here we are. Yes. (He opens out the brooch) How very odd. What are these spaces here?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: There were some beads in it, but they were all loose and falling out - so I took them out.</br></br>Rough: Oh... There were some beads in it, but they were all loose and falling out - so you took them out. Have you got them, by any chance?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes. I think so. I put them in a vase.</br></br>Rough: May I see them, please?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes. (Moving to the vase on the mantelpiece) They should still be here.</br></br>Rough: There should be nine altogether, I think.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes, that's right, I think there were. (Shepicks up the vase and tips several red gems tones out of it) Yes ... Here they are. Here are some of them at any rate.</br></br>Rough: Let me see, will you?</br></br>Mrs Manningham hands the stones to Rough</br></br>Rough: Ah ... Thank you ... Try and find them all, will you?</br></br>Mrs Manningham checks the vase for more stones; four more emerge</br></br>Rough: Did you happen to read this inscription at any time, ma'am?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Yes, I read it. Why?</br></br>Rough: (reading) &quot;Beloved A.B. from C.B. Eighteen fifty-one.&quot; Does nothing strike you about that?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: No. What of it? What should strike me?</br></br>Rough: Really. I should have thought that as simple as ABC. Have you got the others? There should be four more.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (handing over the stones) Yes. Here they are.</br></br>Rough: Thank you. That's the lot. (Heputs the stones into the brooch) Now tell me this - have you ever been embraced by an elderly detective in his shirt sleeves?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: What do you mean?</br></br>Rough: For that is your immediate fate at the moment. (He puts down the brooch and moves to her) My dear Mrs Manningham - (he kisses her) my dear, dear Mrs Manningham! Don't you understand?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: No, what are you so excited about?</br></br>Rough: (leaving her, and picking up the brooch) There you are, Mrs Manningham. The Barlow Rubies - complete. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! (He hands her the brooch and the rubies) Take a good look at them before they go to the Queen.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: But it couldn't be - it couldn't. They were in the vase all the time.</br></br>Rough:

    Don't you see? Don't you see the whole thing? This is where the old lady hid her treasure at night - in a common trinket she wore all the day. I knew I had seen this somewhere before. And where was that? In portraits of the old lady - when I was on the case. She wore it on her breast. I remember it clearly though it was twenty years ago. Twenty years ago!

Well, it is I who am after the big game now. (He shows signs of leaving)</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Are you going?</br></br>Rough: Oh, yes. I must certainly go. (He collects his coat and things during the following) And very quickly at that.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: Where are you going? Are you going to leave me? What are you going to do?</br></br>Rough: I am going to mo ve heaven and earth, Mrs Manningham, and if I have any luck I shall be back tonight. (He looks at his watch) It's very early yet. What time do you think he'll be back?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: I don't know. He's not usually back till eleven. (She closes up the brooch with the rubies inside it)</br></br>Rough: Yes. So I thought. Let's hope so. That will give me time. Here, give me that. Have you closed it? (He takes the brooch) We will put it back where we found it. (He replaces the brooch in the bureau)</br></br>Mrs Manningham: But what are you going to do?</br></br>Rough: It's not exactly what I am going to do. It's what the Government in the person of Sir George Raglan is going to do. Yes, ma'am: Sir George Raglan. No-one less. The power above all the powers that be. He knows I am here tonight, you see. But he didn't know I was going to find what I have found ... (He pauses, looking at the broken drawer) Yes ... We've done for that, I'm afraid... Well, we must just risk it, that's all... Now Mrs Manningham, you will serve the ends of justice best by simply going to bed. Do you mind going to bed?</br></br>Mrs Manningham: No. I will go to bed.</br></br>Rough: Very well then. Go there and stay there. Your headache is worse. Be ill. Be anything. But stay there. I'll let myself out.</br></br>Mrs Manningham: (suddenly) Don't leave me. Please don't leave me.

    You see, Bella, in a life of considerable and varied experience I have hammered out a few principles of action. In fact I actually fancy I know how to deal with my fellow men. I learned it quite early, actually - at school, in fact. There, you know, there were two ways of getting at what you wanted. One was along an intellectual plane, the other along the physical. If one failed one used the other. I took that lesson into life with me. Hitherto, with you, I have worked, with what forbearance and patience I leave you to judge, along the intellectual plane. The time has come now, I believe, to work along the other as well ... You will understand that I am a man of some power ...

    No, sir. Just an old man seeing ghosts. It must be the atmosphere of this house. (Walking about) I can see them everywhere. It's the oddest thing. Do you know one ghost I can see, Mr Manningham? You could hardly believe it.

    Why, it's the ghost of an old woman, sir - the ghost of an old woman twenty years ago - an old woman who once lived in this house, who once lived in this very room. Yes - in this very room. What things I imagine!

    Remarkably clear, sir, I see it... An old woman getting ready to go to bed - here in this very room - an old woman getting ready to go up to bed at the end of the day. Why! There she is. She sits just there. And now it seems I see another ghost as well.

    I see the ghost of a young man, Mr Manningham - a handsome, tall, well-groomed young man. But this young man has murder in his eyes. Why, God bless my soul, he might be you, Mr Manningham - he might be you! The old woman sees him. Don' t you see it all? She screams - screams for help - screams before her throat is cut - cut open with a knife. She lies dead on the floor - the floor of this room of this house. There! (Pause) Now I don't see that ghost any more.

    But I still see the ghost of the man. I see him, all through the night, as he ransacks the house, hour after hour, room after room, ripping everything up. turning everything out, madly seeking the thing he cannot find. Then twenty years pass, and where is he? Why, sir, is he not still in the same house, the house he ransacked, the house he searched - and does he not now stand before the ghost of the woman he killed, in the room in which he killed her? A methodical man, apatient man, but perhaps he has waited too long. For justice has waited too, and here she is, in my person, to exact her due. And justice found, my friend, in one hour what you sought for twenty years, and still could not find. See here. Look what she found. (He moves to the bureau and picks up the bill, the letter and the brooch as he mentions them) First a bill which your wife had lost. Then a letter which never reached your wife. Then a brooch which you gave your wife but which she lost. How wicked of her! But then she didn't know its value. How was she to know that it held the Barlow Rubies. There (He opens out the brooch) See. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! There you are, sir! You killed one woman for those and tried to drive another out of her mind. And all the time they lay in your own desk, and all they have brought you is a rope around your neck! Well, the game is over, Sydney Power, and I advise you to take the matter philosophically.
