Also UL is a cupboard. There is a settee R, DS of the fireplace, an armchair in front of the fire with a little stool beside it, and a table c with books and other items on it and chairs beneath it. There is a bureau against the wall DL WITH a Bible on it, a chair in front of it and a lamp us of it. Another chair DL has Mr Manningham's hat and coat on it. There is another little table with a bottle of medicine upon it and a hook on the wall US where a picture has obviously been hanging until recently. The room's general lighting is by means of two incandescent gas mantles to either side of the fireplace</br>Rather terrifying darkness of the late afternoon - the zero hour, as it were, before the feeble dawn of gaslight and tea. Infront of the fire, in an armchair, Mr Manningham is stretched out and sleeping heavily, a newspaper beside him. He is tall, good-looking, about forty-five.</br>He is heavily moustached and whiskered. He has a fine figure, and is perhaps a little too well-dressed. His manner is suave and authoritative, with a touch of mystery and bitterness. Mrs Manningham is sitting sewing on the settee, a sewing-box beside her. She is about thirty-four. She has been good-looking, almost a beauty - but now she has a haggard, wan, frightened air, with rings under her eyes, which tell of sleepless nights and worse</br>Pause</br>From the street below, in the distance, can be heard the intermittent jingling of a muffin-man ringing his bell. Mrs Manningham listens to this sound for a few moments, furtively and indecisively, almost as though she isfrightened even of this.

Then why - - ?</br>Mrs Manningham: But I think we should consider them a little, that's all.</br>Mr Manningham: Consider them? There's your extraordinary confusion of the mind again. You speak as though they work for no consideration. I happen to consider Elizabeth to the tune of sixteen pounds per annum. And the girl ten. Twenty-six pounds a year all told. And if that is not consideration of the most acute and lively kind, I should like to know what is.</br>Mrs Manningham: Yes, Jack. I expect you are right.</br>Mr Manningham:

Oh, Jack, I'd be better - I could really try to be better - you know in what way - if only I could get out of myself a little more.</br>Mr Manningham: How do you mean, my dear, exactly, better?</br>Mrs Manningham: You know ... You know in what way, dear. About - all that's happened lately. We said we wouldn't speak about it.</br>Mr Manningham:

    No, dear, I don't want to - but what I say is so important. I have been better - even in the last week. Haven't you noticed it? And why is it? Because you have stayed in, and been kind to me. The other night when you stayed in and played cards with me, it was like the old days, and I went to bed feeling a normal, happy, healthy human being. And then, the day after, when you read your book to me, Jack, and we sat by the fire, I felt all my love for you coming back, then, Jack. And I slept that night like a child. All those ghastly dreads and terrible, terrible fears seemed to have vanished. And all just because you had given me your time, and taken me from brooding on myself in this house all day and night.

    No, Jack, dear, it's not my medicine. I've taken my medicine religiously - haven't I taken it religiously? Much as I detest it! It's more than medicine that I want. It's the medicine of a sweet, sane mind, of being interested in something. Don't you see what I mean?

</br>Mrs Manningham: Oh no, I don't. We've been too familiar with her. (She arranges the chairs by the table in an emotionally happy state) Come along, my dear. You sit one side, and I the other, like two children in the nursery.</br>Mr Manningham: (rising and standing with his back to the fire) You seem wonderfully pleased with yourself, Bella. I must take you to the theatre more often, if this is the result.</br>Mrs Manningham: Oh, Jack - I wish you could.</br>Mr Manningham: I don't really know why we shouldn't. I used to like nothing so much when I was a boy. In fact, you may hardly believe it, but  I even had an ambition to be an actor myself at one time.</br>Mrs Manningham: I can well believe it, dear. Come along to your tea now.</br>Mr Manningham: You know, Bella, that must be a very superb sensation. To take a part and lose yourself entirely in the character of someone else. I flatter myself I could have made an actor.</br>Mrs Manningham: Why, of course, my dear. You were cut out for it. Anyone can see that.</br>Mr Manningham: (moving slowly L) No - do you think so - seriously? I always felt a faint tinge of regret.

Oh - you've made a great mistake.</br>Mr Manningham: (sitting to the R of the table) I wonder.</br>Mrs Manningham: Then if you had been a famous actor, I should have had a free seat to come and watch you every night of my life. And then called for you at the stage door afterwards. Wouldn't that have been paradise?</br>Mr Manningham: A paradise of which you would soon tire, my dear. I have no doubt that after a few nights you would be staying at home again, just as you do now.</br>Mrs Manningham: Oh no, I wouldn't. I should have to keep my eye on you for all the hussies that would be after you.</br>Mr Manningham: There would be hussies after me, would there? That is an added inducement, then.</br>Mrs Manningham: Yes - I know it, you wretch. But you wouldn't escape me. (She lifts the cover of the muffin dish and prepares muffins during the following) They look delicious. Aren't you glad I thought of them? Here's some salt. You want heaps of it. Oh, Jack dear, you must forgive me chattering on like this, but I'm feeling so happy.</br>Mr Manningham: I can see that, my dear.</br>Mrs Manningham: I'm being taken to the play, you see.

Jack, if I steal your things - your rings - your keys - your pencils and your handkerchiefs, and you find them later at the bottom of my box, as indeed you do, then I do not know that I have done it... Jack  - if I commit these fantastic, meaningless mischiefs - so meaningless - why should I take a picture down from its place? If I do all these things, then I am certainly going off my head, and must be treated kindly and gently so that I may get well. You must bear with me, Jack, bear with me - not storm and rage. God knows I'm try ing. Jack, I'm try ing! Oh, for God's sake believe that I'm trying, and be kind to me!

    Well, of one thing you can be certain. I have not come to talk about the weather. Though that indeed merits a world of comment at the moment. But you're running away with things, Mrs Manningham, and asking me a good deal I can't answer at once. Instead of that, I am going to ask you a question or two ... Now, please, will you come here and give me your hands?

I am a perfect stranger to you, and you can read little in my face besides that. But I can read a great deal in yours.</br>Mrs Manningham: (after a pause) What?

    Why, madam. I can read the tokens of one who has travelled a very long way upon the path of sorrow and doubt - and will have, I fear, to travel a little further before she comes to the end. But I fancy she is coming towards the end, for all that. Come now. are you going to trust me, and listen to me? I'm old enough to be your grandfather.

In fact, Mrs Manningham, you have in front of you one who was quite a personage in his day - believe it or not.</br>Mrs Manningham: I quite believe it. Won't you sit down?

</br>Mrs Manningham: Every night, after he goes out, I find myself waiting for something. Then all at once I look round the room and see that the light is slowly going down. At first I tried not to notice it, but after a time it began to get on my nerves. I would go all over the house to see if anyone had put on an extra light, but they never had. It's always the same time - about ten minutes after he goes out. That's what made me think that somehow he had come back and that it was he who was walking about up there. I go up to the bedroom but I daren't stay there because I hear noises overhead. I want to scream and run out of the house. I sit here for hours, terrified, waiting for him to come back, and I always know when he's coming again. Suddenly the light goes up again and ten minutes afterwards I hear his key in the lock downstairs, and he's back again.</br>Rough:

    Incessantly - but more and more of late. He gives me things to look after, and when he asks for them they are gone, and can never be found. Then he misses his rings, or his studs, or his razors, and I will hunt the place for them, and he will find them lying hidden at the bottom of my work-box. Twice the door of that room was found locked with the key vanished. That was also found at the bottom of my box. Only today, before you came, that picture had been taken from the wall and hidden. Who could have done it but myself? I try to remember. I break my heart trying to remember. But I can't. Oh, and then there was that terrible business about the dog ...

</mark>
</br>Mrs Manningham: An old lady years ago? What has she to do with me?</br>Rough: A great deal, I fancy, if you will follow me patiently. Her name was  Barlow - Alice Barlow, and she was an old lady of great wealth, and decided eccentricities. In fact, her principal mania in life was the protection of cabmen. You may think that an extraordinary hobby, but in her odd way she did a lot of good. She provided these men with shelters, clothing, pensions, and so forth, and that was her little contribution to the sum of the world's happiness, or rather her little stand against the sum of the world's pain. There is a great deal of pain in this world, Mrs Manningham, you know. Well, it was not my privilege to know her, but it was my duty, on just one occasion, to see her. That was when her throat was cut open, and she lay dead on the floor of her own house.</br>Mrs Manningham: Oh, how horrible! Do you mean she was murdered?</br>Rough: Yes. She was murdered. I was only a comparatively young officer at the time, but it made an extremely horrible, in fact I may say lasting, impression on me. The murderer was never discovered but the motive was obvious enough. The Barlow Rubies had been inherited by her, and it was well known that she kept them, without any proper precautions, in her bedroom on an upper floor. She lived alone except for a deaf servant in the basement. Well, for that she paid the penalty of her life.</br>Mrs Manningham: But what - - ?</br>Rough: There were some sensational features about the case. The man seemed to have got in at about ten at night and stayed till dawn. Apart, presumably, from the jewels, there were only a few trinkets taken, but the whole house had been turned upside down, and in the upper room every single thing was flung about, or torn open. Even the cushions of the chairs were ripped up with his bloody knife, and the police decided that it must have been a revengeful maniac as well as a robber. I had other theories but  I was a nobody then, and not in charge of the case.</br>Mrs Manningham: What were your theories?</br>Rough: Well, it seemed to me, from all that I gathered here and there, that the old lady might have been an eccentric, but that she was by no means a fool. It seemed to me that she might have been one too clever for that man. We presume he killed her to silence her, but what then? What if she had not been so careless? What if she had got those jewels hidden away in some inconceivably cunning place, in the walls, floored down, bricked in, maybe? What if the only person who could tell him where they were was lying dead on the floor! Would not that account, Mrs Manningham, for all the strange confusion in which the place was found. Can't you picture him. Mrs Manningham, searching through the night, ransacking the place, hour after hour, growing more and more desperate, until at last the dawn comes and he has to slink out into the pale street, the blood and wreckage of the night behind. And the deaf servant down in the basement sleeping like a dog through it all.</br>Mrs Manningham: Oh, how horrible! How horrible indeed. And was the man ever found?</br>Rough: No, Mrs Manningham, the man was never found. Nor has the Barlow jewellery ever come to light.</br>Mrs Manningham: Then perhaps he found it after all. and may be alive today.</br>Rough: I think he is almost certainly alive today, but I don't believe he found what he wanted. That is, if my theory is right.</br>Mrs Manningham: Then the jewels may still be where the old lady hid them?</br>Rough: Indeed, Mrs Manningham, if my theory is right, the jewels must still be where she hid them, but then, of course, it was only a theory and that formed in quite a young man, long enough ago. The official conclusion was quite otherwise. The police, naturally and quite excusably presumed that the murderer had got them, and there was no re-opening of matters in those days. Soon enough the public forgot about it. I forgot about it myself. But it would be funny, wouldn't it, Mrs Manningham, if after all these years I should turn out to be right.</br>Mrs Manningham: Yes, yes, indeed. But what has this to do with me?</br>Rough: Ah, that is the whole question, Mrs Manningham. What, indeed? What has the obscure murder of an old lady twenty years ago to do with an attractive, though I am afraid at present somewhat pale and wan young lady in this house, who believes she is going out of her mind, and watches the gaslight going up and down when her husband is out at night? Well, I believe there is a link, however remote, wild and strange it may be, and that is why I am here.</br>Mrs Manningham: It's all so confusing. Won't you - -</br>Rough:

    Do you conceive it possible, Mrs Manningham, that that man might not have given up hope of one day getting at the treasure which lay there, and have bided his time until he could somehow re-enter the house?

</br>Mrs Manningham: Yes. Yes. Possibly. But how - - ?</br>Rough: Can you conceive that he may have waited years - five years, ten years, fifteen years, twenty years even - time in which he may have done many things: gone abroad, got married even, until at last his chance came to resume the search begun on that terrible night?

    You know, Mrs Manningham, of the old theory that the criminal always returns to the scene of his crime. Ah, yes, but in this case there is something more than morbid compulsion. There is treasure there to be unearthed if only he can search again, search methodically, without fear of interruption, without causing suspicion. And how would he do that? Don't you think ...

    You are not going out of your mind, Mrs Manningham, you are slowly, methodically, systematically being driven out of your mind. And why? Because you are married to a criminal maniac who is afraid you are beginning to know too much - a criminal maniac who steals back to his own house at night, still searching for something he could not find twenty years ago. Those are the facts, wild and incredible as they may seem. His name is no more Manningham than mine is. He is Sydney Power and he murdered Alice Barlow in this house. He changed his name, and he has waited all these years, until he found it safe to acquire this house in a legal way. He then acquired the empty house next door. Every night, for the last few weeks, he has entered that house from the back, climbed up on to its roof and come into this house by the skylight. I know that because I have seen him do it. You have watched the gaslight, and been aware of the same thing. He is up there now. Why he should employ this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting at what he wants, God himself only knows. For the same reason, perhaps, that he employs this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting rid of you: that is by slowly driving you mad and sending you into a lunatic asylum. Thank God you are not married to him, and that  I have come here to save you from the workings of his wicked mind.

    Admirable, my dear Bella! Admirable! We shall make a great logician of you yet - a Socrates - a John Stuart Mill! You shall go down to history as the shining mind of your day. That is, if your present history does not altogether submerge you - take you away from your fellow creatures. And there is a danger of that, you know, in more ways than one. Well - what did I say I would do if you did not find that bill?

    You see, Bella, in a life of considerable and varied experience I have hammered out a few principles of action. In fact I actually fancy I know how to deal with my fellow men. I learned it quite early, actually - at school, in fact. There, you know, there were two ways of getting at what you wanted. One was along an intellectual plane, the other along the physical. If one failed one used the other. I took that lesson into life with me. Hitherto, with you, I have worked, with what forbearance and patience I leave you to judge, along the intellectual plane. The time has come now, I believe, to work along the other as well ... You will understand that I am a man of some power ...

    (confronting Manningham) But I still see the ghost of the man. I see him, all through the night, as he ransacks the house, hour after hour, room after room, ripping everything up. turning everything out, madly seeking the thing he cannot find. Then twenty years pass, and where is he? Why, sir, is he not still in the same house, the house he ransacked, the house he searched - and does he not now stand before the ghost of the woman he killed, in the room in which he killed her? A methodical man, apatient man, but perhaps he has waited too long. For justice has waited too, and here she is, in my person, to exact her due. And justice found, my friend, in one hour what you sought for twenty years, and still could not find. See here. Look what she found. (He moves to the bureau and picks up the bill, the letter and the brooch as he mentions them) First a bill which your wife had lost. Then a letter which never reached your wife. Then a brooch which you gave your wife but which she lost. How wicked of her! But then she didn't know its value. How was she to know that it held the Barlow Rubies. There (He opens out the brooch) See. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! There you are, sir! You killed one woman for those and tried to drive another out of her mind. And all the time they lay in your own desk, and all they have brought you is a rope around your neck! Well, the game is over, Sydney Power, and I advise you to take the matter philosophically.

    (moving to him) Or is it I who am mad? Yes. That is it. Of course. I am mad. It was a key, and I have lost it. Dear God - I have lost it, haven't I? I am always losing things. And I can never find them. I don't know where I put them.

    Where could it be now? Could it be behind the picture? Yes, it must be there. (She goes to the picture and takes it down) No - it is not there - how strange.

(She goes to the desk) No, it is not here. (She picks up the bill, the letter and the watch as she mentions them) Here is a bill. Here is a letter. Here is a watch. See. (She moves to him, the items in her hand) Take them. I have found them at last, you see! But they don't help you, do they? And I am trying to help you, aren't I? To help you to escape ... But how can a mad woman help her husband to escape? What a pity ... (Getting louder and louder) If I were not mad I could have helped you - if I were not mad, whatever you had done, I could have pitied and protected you! But because I am mad I have hated you, and because I am mad I have betrayed you, and because I am mad I am rejoicing with my heart - without a shred of pity - without a shred of regret - watching you go with glory in my heart! (She pauses, looking at him. She breathes deeply. She suddenly goes to the door UL and flings it open) Inspector! Inspector! Come and take this man away! Come and take this man away!
