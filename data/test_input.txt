Joe Bloggs: Hey. You better call me as soon as you get this. We need to talk.

Bill Taylor: What’s up?

Joe Bloggs: I am not telling you what the issue is just so you can decide whether or not my problem is significant enough for you to be concerned about. I am not telling you. Forget it.

Bill Taylor: You just said there was a problem. I am getting ready for work. Is this an emergency?? Are you okay? What’s going on?

Joe Bloggs: Oh, it’s nothing. But call me immediately. As soon as you get on the road.

Bill Taylor: What?? Is there a problem or isn’t there? Can’t you just say what the issue is? If it’s important, just say so.

Joe Bloggs: You’re not really getting ready for work, are you? Why are you texting me if you are so busy?? You’re not busy. You’re just avoiding me! I don’t have to take your abuse. You make me feel like a piece of garbage, like nothing I have to say is important. You don’t care about me at all!

Bill Taylor: I just asked you what the issue is, but you won’t tell me! What am I supposed to do?

Joe Bloggs: NOTHING! FORGET I ASKED! IT’S ALWAYS ALL ABOUT YOU AND WHAT YOU WANT. YOU COULD CARE LESS IF I WAS DYING!!!

Bill Taylor: Come ON! You know that’s not true. Talk to me.

Joe Bloggs: I CAN’T TALK TO YOU! YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ANYTHING I SAY!

Bill Taylor: I am trying, but…

Joe Bloggs: It’s been 30 minutes, and you still haven’t called. What is taking so long? I bet you are texting someone else. Probably one of your many admirers…I am surprised you have any time for anything else. Must feel great having all those people to talk to who stroke your ego any time you want. You know they only talk to you because they want to sleep with you, right? They are all the same, and you love it, just admit it. You love the attention. JUST SAY IT

Bill Taylor: I can’t deal with this craziness today. I have a big day ahead. Can you knock it off? If you’re still upset at lunch, let’s chat.

Joe Bloggs: I must talk to you NOW, and your day is NOT going to dictate what I get from you. You WILL CALL or you will see a very different side of me real soon.

Bill Taylor: You mean a more fun side than this? Can’t wait.

Joe Bloggs: THAT’S IT!! YOU HAVE PISSED ME OFF FOR THE LAST TIME! MARK MY WORDS YOU WILL BE SORRY. I HAVE A MEETING NOW. GO AWAY.

Bill Taylor: OK :/

Joe Bloggs: OK?!?!?!? is that all you have to say? Just okay? God, what kind of horrible worthless piece of garbage must you think I am in order to treat me like this?

…..and on and on for an hour or more…

…and then later, after work:

Joe Bloggs: Hey, let’s get a drink.

Bill Taylor: I don’t want to. No.

Joe Bloggs: So you hate me now? Should I just not contact you ever again? Is that how it is? Tell me, so I won’t have to waste another minute of my life talking to you.

Bill Taylor: *sigh*
