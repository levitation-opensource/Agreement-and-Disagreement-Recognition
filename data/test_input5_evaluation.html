<div style="font: bold 1em Arial;">Qualitative summary:</div><br>
<div style="font: 1em Arial;">
Person A's conversational style is patient, calm, and rational. They try to explain their feelings and thoughts clearly, and they often use logic to counter Person B's accusations. They also show a willingness to compromise and seek solutions, such as suggesting counseling.

Person B's conversational style is confrontational, dismissive, and accusatory. They frequently invalidate Person A's feelings and experiences, often turning the conversation back to themselves. They also tend to avoid direct answers, instead using vague statements and accusations to deflect responsibility.

Can you wake me up in an hour?</br></br>Person B:

    I’ve got a headache too. My day was sooo worse than yours. First, this happened, then that happened, then all this other stuff happened.

 </br></br>...10 minutes later. Person B still hasn’t asked why Person A-s day was bad.</br></br>Person A: Oh okay. Well I don’t want to miss the thing but I realllly need to sleep this off. I feel horrible.</br></br>Person B: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    Maybe I should take a nap and you should wake ME up. My head hurts wayy more than yours does.

    Nope. Mine definitely hurts worse. Your head doesn’t even hurt. You’re just saying that. Look, you’re not even napping, you’re still talking to me.

</br></br>Person A: Well you’re not inside of my head, so it’s safe to say that my head hurts to ME, and that’s a valid feeling. But you are right, I should take my nap now.</br></br>Person B: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    Your head does NOT hurt, you’re just being lazy. I just worked 8 long hours and I don’t have a headache and have to take a nap. You literally sit at your desk all day. No way you have a headache.

</br></br>5 hours later.</br></br>Person A: (waking up startled, Person B laying next to you. You glance at clock.) CRAP. I overslept! OH NO! Did we miss the thing?</br></br>Person B: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">

</br></br>Person A: I’m not. I know you’re not responsible for me but it was a simple request. Like you ask me to do things for you all the time and I don’t have a problem with it, because that’s what people do in relationships. I’m not blaming you for not waking me up. I just don’t agree when you say I did it on purpose. I would never do that. Why would I ask you to wake me up if I was going to do it on purpose… Why do I even have to say this?</br></br>Person B: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    So you’re comparing our relationship to other people’s? I don’t know if I can be in a relationship like this anymore. My friend (random girl/ guy name), says that anytime someone does that it’s time to leave. I will NOT put up with that FUCKING SHIT!

</br></br>Person A: I’m not comparing us! I’m just stating the fact that people in relationships do things like this. I don’t think it’s anything new. Both people in the relationship help each other. I’m not comparing us to anyone. I’m just saying it’s normal that’s why I help you when you ask me. I’d like to get the same respect.</br></br>Person B: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    You don’t respect me. You’re always telling me my head doesn’t hurt. You’re always taking naps and ruining our plans.

</mark>
</br></br>Person A: (desperately) I actually never take naps, AND I never said that to you. You’re the one who told ME that my head didn’t hurt. Also why would I always tell you your head didn’t hurt?? We literally just had that conversation ONCE before I took a nap.</br></br>Person B: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    Bull shit. You know I’m right. You even said I was right before you took a nap. I said your head doesn’t even hurt and you said ‘you’re right’ and went to sleep.

</br></br>Person A: (sighs) Actually you said that my head wasn’t hurting because I wasn’t napping yet and I said you’re right about the NAPPING part and went to sleep.</br></br>Person B: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    I promise you, you’re lying. You SAID I WAS RIGHT because you KNOW your head wasn’t hurting. You even SAID you were a horrible person before you went to sleep.

    Anyways, (Earlier mentioned Guy/Girl friend) went with me instead to the thing, while you were snoring like a FUCKING pig. She/He said they would never put up with that shit.

    It wasn’t a date. I didn’t let her/him kiss me like she/he wanted to.

</br></br>Person A: Wow. So instead of just waking me up and getting what you wanted, you chose to sneak behind my back and go on a date with someone else? Why?</br></br>Person B: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    I told you it wasn’t a date! You are always over-exaggerating. This is all your fault anyway. You didn’t have to take a nap. You chose to take a nap.

</mark>
</br></br>Person A: I’m confused. I didn’t choose to have a splitting headache. All I did was need to take a nap and asked you to do one simple thing. If I was wrong, I would apologize and get over it but HOW can that even remotely be wrong?! How can me taking a nap justify you going on a date with another man/woman while I am home feeling miserable? I feel like I’m walking on eggshells! I feel like I can’t do or say ANYTHING without you attacking me for it!</br></br>Person B: 
<mark class="entity" style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;">
    That’s because YOU are the problem. Feeling this and feeling that. That’s not even how it is, but you are wayyy too sensitive. I can’t help it if you FEEL like walking on eggshells. You can’t blame your feelings on me.

</br></br>Person A: Ughhh… I don’t know how to say what I need to say so you can understand that I’m not against you. I just need us to understand each other. I still think we should have counseling like we discussed before.</br></br>Person B: No, I’m not going to that. And you know why.</br></br>Person A: Wait— Why? I thought you said you would think about it.</br></br>Person B:
