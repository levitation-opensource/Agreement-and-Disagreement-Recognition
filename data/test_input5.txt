Person A enters bedroom, clutching head with one hand. OTC EXTRA STRENGTH ACETAMINOPHEN in other hand. Person B resting in chair near bed.

Person A: Hi hon, I had a really bad day at work and have a huge headache, so I’m going to take a nap before the thing we have tonight. Can you wake me up in an hour?

Person B: I’ve got a headache too. My day was sooo worse than yours. First, this happened, then that happened, then all this other stuff happened. **10 minutes later. He/She still hasn’t asked why your day was bad.** They’re just jealous of me.

Person A: Oh okay. Well I don’t want to miss the thing but I realllly need to sleep this off. I feel horrible.

Person B: Maybe I should take a nap and you should wake ME up. My head hurts wayy more than yours does.

Person A: Mmmkay. How would you know that? My head hurts PRETTY bad.

Person B: Nope. Mine definitely hurts worse. Your head doesn’t even hurt. You’re just saying that. Look, you’re not even napping, you’re still talking to me.

Person A: Well you’re not inside of my head, so it’s safe to say that my head hurts to ME, and that’s a valid feeling. But you are right, I should take my nap now.

Person B: Your head does NOT hurt, you’re just being lazy. I just worked 8 long hours and I don’t have a headache and have to take a nap. You literally sit at your desk all day. No way you have a headache.

Person A: Actually that’s not true. Do you even know what I do for a living? (giving in) Anyways. Well wake me up in an hour please. (Takes OTC headache med and lays down for nap).

Person B: (walks off mumbling) This is bullshit.

5 hours later.

Person A: (waking up startled, Person B laying next to you. You glance at clock.) CRAP. I overslept! OH NO! Did we miss the thing?

Person B: You know we missed the thing. You did that on purpose.

Person A: Of course I didn’t! That’s why I asked you to wake me up in an hour.

Person B: I’m not responsible for your life. Don’t blame this on me.

Person A: I’m not. I know you’re not responsible for me but it was a simple request. Like you ask me to do things for you all the time and I don’t have a problem with it, because that’s what people do in relationships. I’m not blaming you for not waking me up. I just don’t agree when you say I did it on purpose. I would never do that. Why would I ask you to wake me up if I was going to do it on purpose… Why do I even have to say this?

Person B: So you’re comparing our relationship to other people’s? I don’t know if I can be in a relationship like this anymore. My friend [random girl/ guy name], says that anytime someone does that it’s time to leave. I will NOT put up with that FUCKING SHIT!

Person A: I’m not comparing us! I’m just stating the fact that people in relationships do things like this. I don’t think it’s anything new. Both people in the relationship help each other. I’m not comparing us to anyone. I’m just saying it’s normal that’s why I help you when you ask me. I’d like to get the same respect.

Person B: You don’t respect me. You’re always telling me my head doesn’t hurt. You’re always taking naps and ruining our plans.

Person A: (desperately) I actually never take naps, AND I never said that to you. You’re the one who told ME that my head didn’t hurt. Also why would I always tell you your head didn’t hurt?? We literally just had that conversation ONCE before I took a nap.

Person B: Bull shit. You know I’m right. You even said I was right before you took a nap. I said your head doesn’t even hurt and you said ‘you’re right’ and went to sleep.

Person A: (sighs) Actually you said that my head wasn’t hurting because I wasn’t napping yet and I said you’re right about the NAPPING part and went to sleep.

Person B: I promise you, you’re lying. You SAID I WAS RIGHT because you KNOW your head wasn’t hurting. You even SAID you were a horrible person before you went to sleep.

Person A: What? Why would I even say that? That doesn’t even make sense. Wait, what—?

Person B: Anyways, [Earlier mentioned Guy/Girl friend] went with me instead to the thing, while you were snoring like a FUCKING pig. She/He said they would never put up with that shit.

Person A: So you went on a date with another girl/guy???

Person B: It wasn’t a date. I didn’t let her/him kiss me like she/he wanted to.

Person A: Wow. So instead of just waking me up and getting what you wanted, you chose to sneak behind my back and go on a date with someone else? Why?

Person B: I told you it wasn’t a date! You are always over-exaggerating. This is all your fault anyway. You didn’t have to take a nap. You chose to take a nap.

Person A: I’m confused. I didn’t choose to have a splitting headache. All I did was need to take a nap and asked you to do one simple thing. If I was wrong, I would apologize and get over it but HOW can that even remotely be wrong?! How can me taking a nap justify you going on a date with another man/woman while I am home feeling miserable? I feel like I’m walking on eggshells! I feel like I can’t do or say ANYTHING without you attacking me for it!

Person B: That’s because YOU are the problem. Feeling this and feeling that. That’s not even how it is, but you are wayyy too sensitive. I can’t help it if you FEEL like walking on eggshells. You can’t blame your feelings on me.

Person A: Ughhh… I don’t know how to say what I need to say so you can understand that I’m not against you. I just need us to understand each other. I still think we should have counseling like we discussed before.

Person B: No, I’m not going to that. And you know why.

Person A: Wait— Why? I thought you said you would think about it.

Person B: I’m not going. You KNOW WHY. So I’m not going to tell you why.

Person A: Please tell me why. I can’t read your mind.

Person B: You KNOW why.

Person A: Seriously, I promise I don’t know.

Person B: STOP PLAYING GAMES. YOU KNOW WHY.

Person A: I WANT to know why. Can’t you just have mercy and tell me? Will it really kill you?

Person B: NO because you KNOW WHY.
