Person A came home from their summer job the next day to find the kittens missing.

Person A: “Have you seen the kittens? They aren't in their crate!”

Person B: “Yes. They don't live here anymore.”

Person A: *confused*: “Uhhhhh, what do you mean? I have someone that wants to come see them…”

Person B: *silence*

Person A: “Person B, what did you do? Did you give them away?” (Person A ended on a hopeful note, unable to imagine what Person B was about to say).

Person B: “I let them go free.”

Person A: *panicked* “What do you mean?!”

Person B: “I drove them down to a nice gated community in Desert Shores and put them on some grass.”

Person A is completely stunned to the point of silence. Person A can't even squeak out a word as tears rush to their eyes and their heart sinks into their innards.

Person B: “Someone will find them. It'sa nice area. They'll find a good home.”
