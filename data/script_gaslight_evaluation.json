  "sanitised_text": "A living-room on the first floor of a four-storeyed house in a gloomy and unfashionable quarter of London. The latter part of the nineteenth century.\n\nLate afternoon\n\nThe room is furnished in all the heavily draped and dingy profusion of the period and yet, amidst this abundance of paraphernalia, an air is breathed of poverty, wretchedness and age\n\nThere is a fireplace R with a mirror over it and a vase on the mantelpiece.\n\nThere is a door us of the fireplace leading to a little room, a window in the back wall c, with blinds and curtains, and a door UL which leads to a passage and the (unseen) stairs, with a bell-cord hanging beside it. Also UL is a cupboard. There is a settee R, DS of the fireplace, an armchair in front of the fire with a little stool beside it, and a table c with books and other items on it and chairs beneath it. There is a bureau against the wall DL WITH a Bible on it, a chair in front of it and a lamp us of it. Another chair DL has Mr Manningham's hat and coat on it. There is another little table with a bottle of medicine upon it and a hook on the wall US where a picture has obviously been hanging until recently. The room's general lighting is by means of two incandescent gas mantles to either side of the fireplace\n\nRather terrifying darkness of the late afternoon - the zero hour, as it were, before the feeble dawn of gaslight and tea. Infront of the fire, in an armchair, Mr Manningham is stretched out and sleeping heavily, a newspaper beside him. He is tall, good-looking, about forty-five.\n\nHe is heavily moustached and whiskered. He has a fine figure, and is perhaps a little too well-dressed. His manner is suave and authoritative, with a touch of mystery and bitterness. Mrs Manningham is sitting sewing on the settee, a sewing-box beside her. She is about thirty-four. She has been good-looking, almost a beauty - but now she has a haggard, wan, frightened air, with rings under her eyes, which tell of sleepless nights and worse\n\nPause\n\nFrom the street below, in the distance, can be heard the intermittent jingling of a muffin-man ringing his bell. Mrs Manningham listens to this sound for a few moments, furtively and indecisively, almost as though she isfrightened even of this. She rustles quickly over to the window and looks down into the street, then to the bell-cord by the door, which she pulls, then back to her sewing, which she gathers up and puts into the box, at the same time taking a purse from the box\n\nThere is a knock at the door, and Elizabeth, the cook and housekeeper, enters.\n\nShe is a stout, amiable, subservient woman of about fifty\n\nMrs Manningham signals that her husband is asleep then goes over and whispers to Elizabeth at the door, giving her some money from the purse\n\nElizabeth exits\n\nMr Manningham's eyes open but his position does not change a fraction of an inch\n\nMr Manningham: What are you doing, Bella?\n\nMrs Manningham: Nothing, dear... (She moves back to the window to look out) Don't wake yourself.\n\nThere is a pause. She goes to her sewing-box, replaces the purse in it and puts the box away, then moves to the window again\n\nMr Manningham: (closing his eyes again) What are you doing, Bella? Come here ...\n\nMrs Manningham hesitates then moves to her husband\n\nMrs Manningham: Only for tea, my dear. Muffins - for tea ... (She takes his hand)\n\nMr Manningham: Muffins ... Eh ... ?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, dear ... He only comes so seldom ... I thought I might surprise you.\n\nMr Manningham: Why are you so apprehensive, Bella? I was not about to reproach you.\n\nMrs Manningham: (nervously releasing his hand) No, dear. I know you weren't. (She moves back to the window)\n\nMr Manningham: This fire's in ashes. Ring the bell, will you, Bella dear, please?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes ... (She moves towards the bell, but stops) Is it merely to put coal on, my dear? I can do that.\n\nMr Manningham: Now then, Bella. We've had this out before. Be so good as to ring the bell.\n\nMrs Manningham: But, dear - Lizzie's out in the street. Let me do it. I can do it so easily. (She moves over to the fireplace)\n\nMr Manningham: (stopping her with an outstretched hand) No, no, no, no, no ... Where's the girl? Let the girl come up if Lizzie's out.\n\nMrs Manningham: But, my dear - -\n\nMr Manningham: Go and ring the bell, please, Bella - there's a good child.\n\nMrs Manningham gives in, and rings the bell\n\nMr Manningham: What do you suppose the servants are for, Bella?\n\nMrs Manningham does not answer. There is a pause\n\nMr Manningham: Go on. Answer me. What do you suppose servants are for?\n\nMrs Manningham: (shamefacedly, and scarcely audibly, merely dutifully feeding him) To serve us, I suppose, Jack ...\n\nMrs Manningham: Precisely. Then why - - ?\n\nMrs Manningham: But I think we should consider them a little, that's all.\n\nMr Manningham: Consider them? There's your extraordinary confusion of the mind again. You speak as though they work for no consideration. I happen to consider Elizabeth to the tune of sixteen pounds per annum. And the girl ten. Twenty-six pounds a year all told. And if that is not consideration of the most acute and lively kind, I should like to know what is.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, Jack. I expect you are right.\n\nMr Manningham: I have no doubt of it, my dear. It's sheer weak mindedness to think otherwise. (Pause) What's the weather doing? Is it still as yellow?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, it seems to be denser than ever. Shall you be going out in this, Jack dear?\n\nMr Manningham: Oh - I expect so. Unless it gets very much worse after tea.\n\nThere is a knock at the door. Mrs Manningham hesitates. There is another knock\n\nMrs Manningham: Come in.\n\nNancy, the maid, enters. She is a self-conscious, pretty, cheeky girl of nineteen\n\nMrs Manningham hesitates to tell Nancy why she rang the bell. Nancy looks at the Manninghams\n\nNancy: Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought the bell rang ...\n\nMr Manningham: Yes, we rang the bell, Nancy... (Pause) Go on, my dear, tell her why we rang the bell.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh ... Yes... We want some coal on the fire, Nancy, please.\n\nNancy looks impudently at Mrs Manningham, and then, with a little smile and toss of the head, goes over and puts coal on the fire\n\nMr Manningham: (after a pause) And you might as well light the gas, Nancy. This darkness in the afternoon is getting beyond endurance.\n\nNancy: Yes, sir. (She gets the matches, with another barely discernible little smile, and lights the two incandescent mantles during the following)\n\nMr Manningham rises, stretches himself, and stands warming his legs in front of the fire. He watches Nancy as she lights the second mantle\n\nMr Manningham: You're looking very impudent and pretty this afternoon, Nancy. Do you know that?\n\nNancy: I don't know that at all, sir, I'm sure.\n\nMrs Manningham: What is it? Another broken heart added to your list?\n\nNancy: I wasn't aware of breaking any hearts, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: I'm sure that's not true. And that complexion of yours. That's not true, either. I wonder what mysterious lotions you've been employing to enhance your natural beauties.\n\nNancy: I'm quite natural, sir. I promise you.\n\nDuring the following, Nancy moves to the window, lowers the blind and draws the curtains, then lights the lamp L\n\nMr Manningham: But you do it adroitly, I grant you that. What are your secrets? Won't you tell us the name of your chemist? Perhaps you could pass it on to Mrs Manningham - and help banish her pallor. She would be most grateful, I have no doubt.\n\nNancy: I'd be most happy to, I'm sure, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: Or are women too jealous of their discoveries to pass them on to a rival?\n\nNancy: I don't know, sir ... Will that be all you're wanting, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Yes. That's all I want, Nancy - except my tea.\n\nNancy: I'll be coming directly, sir.\n\nNancy exits\n\nMrs Manningham: (after a pause, reproachfully rather than angrily) Oh, Jack, how can you treat me like that?\n\nMr Manningham: But, my dear, you're the mistress of the house. It was your business to tell her to put the coal on.\n\nMrs Manningham: It isn't that! It's humiliating me like that. As though I'd do anything to my face, and ask for her assistance if I did.\n\nMr Manningham: But you seem to look upon the servants as our natural equals. So I treated her as one. (He picks up his paper and sits down on the settee) Besides, I was only trifling with her.\n\nMrs Manningham: It's strange that you can't see how you hurt me. That girl laughs at me enough already.\n\nMr Manningham: Laughs at you? What an idea. What makes you think she laughs at you?\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh - I know she does in secret. In fact, she does so openly - more openly every day.\n\nMr Manningham: But, my dear- if she does that, doesn't the fault lie with you?\n\nMrs Manningham: (after a pause) You mean that I am a laughable person?\n\nMr Manningham: I don't mean anything. It's you who read meanings into everything, Bella dear. I wish you weren't such a perfect little silly. Come here and stop it. I've just thought of something rather nice.\n\nMrs Manningham: Something nice? What have you thought of, Jack?\n\nMr Manningham: I shan't tell you unless you come here.\n\nMrs Manningham: (going over and sitting on the little stool beside him) What is it. Jack? What have you thought of?\n\nMr Manningham: I read that Mr MacNaughton - the celebrated actor - is in London for another season.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. I read that. What of it. Jack?\n\nMr Manningham: What of it? What do you suppose?\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, Jack dear. Do you mean it? Would you take me to see MacNaughton? You wouldn't take me to see MacNaughton, would you?\n\nMr Manningham: I not only would take you to see MacNaughton, my dear. I am going to take you to see MacNaughton. That is, if you want to go.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, Jack! What heaven - what heaven!\n\nMr Manningham: When would you like to go? (He refers to the newspaper) You have only three weeks, according to his advertisement.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh - what perfect heaven! Let me see. Do let me see!\n\nMr Manningham: (showing her the advertisement) There. You see? You can see him in comedy or tragedy - according to your choice. Which would you prefer. Bella - the comedy or the tragedy?\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh - it's so hard to say! Either would be equally wonderful. Which would you choose, if you were me?\n\nMr Manningham: Well - it depends - doesn't it - upon whether you want to laugh, or whether you want to cry.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh - I want to laugh. But then, I should like to cry, too. In fact, I should like to do both. Oh, Jack, what made you decide to take me?\n\nMr Manningham: Well, my dear, you've been very good lately, and I thought it would be well to take you out of yourself.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, Jack dear. You have been so much kinder lately. Is it possible you're beginning to see my point of view?\n\nMr Manningham: I don't know that I ever differed from it, did I, Bella?\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, Jack dear. It's true. It's true. All I need is to be taken out of myself - some little changes - to have some attention from you. Oh, Jack, I'd be better - I could really try to be better - you know in what way - if only I could get out of myself a little more.\n\nMr Manningham: How do you mean, my dear, exactly, better?\n\nMrs Manningham: You know ... You know in what way, dear. About - all that's happened lately. We said we wouldn't speak about it.\n\nMr Manningham: Oh, no - don't let's speak about that.\n\nMrs Manningham: No, dear, I don't want to - but what I say is so important. I have been better - even in the last week. Haven't you noticed it? And why is it? Because you have stayed in, and been kind to me. The other night when you stayed in and played cards with me, it was like the old days, and I went to bed feeling a normal, happy, healthy human being. And then, the day after, when you read your book to me, Jack, and we sat by the fire, I felt all my love for you coming back, then, Jack. And I slept that night like a child. All those ghastly dreads and terrible, terrible fears seemed to have vanished. And all just because you had given me your time, and taken me from brooding on myself in this house all day and night.\n\nMr Manningham: I wonder if it is that - or whether it's merely that your medicine is beginning to benefit you?\n\nMrs Manningham: No, Jack, dear, it's not my medicine. I've taken my medicine religiously - haven't I taken it religiously? Much as I detest it! It's more than medicine that I want. It's the medicine of a sweet, sane mind, of being interested in something. Don't you see what I mean?\n\nMr Manningham: Well - we are talking about gloomy subjects, aren't we?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. I don't want to be gloomy, dear - that's the last thing I want to be. I only want you to understand. Say you understand.\n\nMr Manningham: Well, dear. Don't I seem to? Haven't I just said I'm taking you to the theatre?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, dear ... Yes, you have. Oh, and you've made me so happy - so happy, dear.\n\nMr Manningham: Well, then, which is it to be - the comedy orthe tragedy? You must make up your mind.\n\nMrs Manningham: (with exulting solemnity) Oh, Jack, which shall it be? Which shall it be? (She rises and shows her pleasure with delighted gestures) It matters so little! Do you understand that, my husband! I'm going to the play! (She kisses him)\n\nThere is a knock on the door\n\nMrs Manningham: Come in.\n\nNancy enters, carrying a tray with tea things on it, including salt for the muffins. There is a pause as she brings the tray to the fireside, R\n\nMrs Manningham: No, Nancy, I think we'll have it on the table today.\n\nNancy: (still with impudence) Oh - just as you wish, madam.\n\nThere is a pause as Nancy puts the tray in the centre of the table, arranges the cups and moves the books, et cetera, one side\n\nMrs Manningham: (from her place at the mantelpiece) Tell me, Nancy - if you were being taken to the play, and had to choose between comedy and tragedy, which would you choose?\n\nNancy: Me, madam? Oh - I'd go for the comedy all the time.\n\nMrs Manningham: Would you? Why would you choose comedy, Nancy?\n\nNancy: I like to laugh, madam, I suppose.\n\nMrs Manningham: Do you? Well - I daresay you're right. I must bear it in mind. Mr Manningham's taking me next week, you see.\n\nNancy: Oh yes? I hope you enjoy it. I'll bring out the muffins directly.\n\nNancy exits\n\nMrs Manningham puts out her tongue at Nancy. Mr Manningham sees this\n\nMr Manningham: My dear - what are you doing?\n\nMrs Manningham: The little beast! Let her put that in her pipe and smoke it.\n\nMr Manningham: But what has she done?\n\nMrs Manningham: Ah - you don't know her. She tries to torment and score off me all day long. You don't see these things. A man wouldn't. She thinks me a poor thing. And now she can suffer the news that you're taking me to the theatre.\n\nMr Manningham: I think you imagine things, my dear.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh no, I don't. We've been too familiar with her. (She arranges the chairs by the table in an emotionally happy state) Come along, my dear. You sit one side, and I the other, like two children in the nursery.\n\nMr Manningham: (rising and standing with his back to the fire) You seem wonderfully pleased with yourself, Bella. I must take you to the theatre more often, if this is the result.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, Jack - I wish you could.\n\nMr Manningham: I don't really know why we shouldn't. I used to like nothing so much when I was a boy. In fact, you may hardly believe it, but I even had an ambition to be an actor myself at one time.\n\nMrs Manningham: I can well believe it, dear. Come along to your tea now.\n\nMr Manningham: You know, Bella, that must be a very superb sensation. To take a part and lose yourself entirely in the character of someone else. I flatter myself I could have made an actor.\n\nMrs Manningham: Why, of course, my dear. You were cut out for it. Anyone can see that.\n\nMr Manningham: (moving slowly L) No - do you think so - seriously? I always felt a faint tinge of regret. Of course, one would have required training, but I believe I should have made out - and might have reached the top of the tree for all I know.\n\nNancy enters with a dish of muffins during the following recitation (at the point marked *), puts the muffins on the table and exits\n\nMr Manningham: To be or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer. The slings and arrows* of outrageous fortune. Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And, by opposing, end them?\n\nMrs Manningham: You see how fine your voice is? Oh - you've made a great mistake.\n\nMr Manningham: (sitting to the R of the table) I wonder.\n\nMrs Manningham: Then if you had been a famous actor, I should have had a free seat to come and watch you every night of my life. And then called for you at the stage door afterwards. Wouldn't that have been paradise?\n\nMr Manningham: A paradise of which you would soon tire, my dear. I have no doubt that after a few nights you would be staying at home again, just as you do now.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh no, I wouldn't. I should have to keep my eye on you for all the hussies that would be after you.\n\nMr Manningham: There would be hussies after me, would there? That is an added inducement, then.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes - I know it, you wretch. But you wouldn't escape me. (She lifts the cover of the muffin dish and prepares muffins during the following) They look delicious. Aren't you glad I thought of them? Here's some salt. You want heaps of it. Oh, Jack dear, you must forgive me chattering on like this, but I'm feeling so happy.\n\nMr Manningham: I can see that, my dear.\n\nMrs Manningham: I'm being taken to the play, you see. Here you are. I used to adore these as a child, didn't you? I wonder how long it is since we had them? We haven't had them since we've been married anyway. Or have we? Have we ...?\n\nMr Manningham: (suddenly rising, looking at the wall opposite him; in a calm, yet menacing voice) I don't know, I'm sure ... I don't know ...\n\nBella: - -\n\nMrs Manningham: (after a pause, dropping her voice almost to a whisper) What is it? What's the matter? What is it now?\n\nMr Manningham: (walking over to thefireplace, and speaking with his back to her) I have no desire to upset you, Bella, but I have just observed something very much amiss. Will you please rectify it at once, while I am not looking, and we will assume that it has not happened.\n\nMrs Manningham: Amiss? What's amiss? For God's sake don't turn your back on me. What has happened?\n\nMr Manningham: You know perfectly well what has happened, Bella, and if you will rectify it at once I will say no more about it.\n\nMrs Manningham: I don't know. I don't know. You have left your tea. Tell me what it is. Tell me.\n\nMr Manningham: Are you trying to make a fool of me, Bella? What I refer to is on the wall behind you. If you will put it back, I will forget the matter.\n\nMrs Manningham: The wall behind me? What? (She turns) Oh ... Yes ... The picture has been taken down. Yes ... The pictures... Who has taken it down? Why has it been taken down ...?\n\nMr Manningham: Yes. Why has it been taken down? Why, indeed? You alone can answer that, Bella. Why was it taken down before? Will you please take it from wherever you have hidden it, and put it back on the wall again.\n\nMrs Manningham: But I haven't hidden it, Jack. I didn' t do it. Oh, for God's sake look at me. I didn't do it. I don't know where it is. Someone else must have done it.\n\nMr Manningham: Someone else? Are you suggesting that I should play such a fantastic and wicked trick?\n\nMrs Manningham: No, dear, no! But someone else. (She moves to him) Before God. I didn't do it! Someone else, dear, someone else. (She reaches out to him)\n\nMr Manningham: Someone else, eh? Someone else. (Shaking her off ) Will you leave go of me. You repel me - you half-witted thing. (He walks over to the bell-cord) We will see about \"someone else\".\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh. Jack - don't ring the bell. Don't ring it. Don't call the servants to witness my shame. It's not my shame for I haven't done it - but don't call the servants! Tell them not to come.\n\nMr Manningham rings the bell\n\nMrs Manningham: (Moving to him and touching him again) Let's talk of this between ourselves! Don't call that girl in. Please!\n\nMr Manningham: (shaking her off violently) Will you leave go of me and sit down there! (He moves to the fireplace) Someone else - eh? Well - we shall see.\n\nMrs Manningham sits in the armchair and sobs\n\nMr Manningham: You had better pull yourself together, hadn't you ... ?\n\nThere is a knock on the door\n\nMr Manningham: Come in.\n\nElizabeth enters\n\nMr Manningham: Ah, Elizabeth, do you notice anything amiss in this room? Look carefully around the walls, and see if you notice anything amiss ... Well, Elizabeth, what do you notice?\n\nElizabeth: Nothing, sir - except the picture's been taken down.\n\nMr Manningham: Exactly. The picture has been taken down. You noticed it at once. Now was that picture in its place when you dusted the room this morning?\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir. It was, sir. I don't understand, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: Neither do I, Elizabeth, neither do I. And now, before you go, just one question. Was it you who removed that picture, Elizabeth?\n\nElizabeth: No, sir. Of course I ain't, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: You did not. And have you ever, at any time, removed that picture from its proper place?\n\nElizabeth: No, sir. Never, sir. Why should I, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Indeed, why should you? And now please, will you kiss that Bible, which lies on that desk there, as a token of your truthfulness...\n\nElizabeth hesitates. There is a pause. Then she kisses the Bible\n\nMr Manningham: Very well, you may go. And please send Nancy in here at once.\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir.\n\nElizabeth exits, looking at both the Manninghams as she goes\n\nMrs Manningham: (moving to Mr Manningham) Jack - spare me that girl. Don't call her in. I'll say anything. I'll say that I did it. I did it, Jack, I did it. Don't have that girl in. Don't!\n\nMr Manningham: Will you have the goodness to contain yourself?\n\nMrs Manningham sits again. There is a knock at the door\n\nMr Manningham: Come in.\n\nNancy enters\n\nNancy: Yes, sir? Did you want me?\n\nMr Manningham: Yes, I do want you, Nancy ... If you will look at the wall on your left, you will see that the picture has gone.\n\nNancy: (moving DL) Why. My word. So it has. What a rum go!\n\nMr Manningham: I did not ask for any comment on your part, Nancy. Kindly be less insolent and answer what I ask you. Did you take that picture down, or did you not?\n\nNancy: Me? Of course I didn't. What should I want to move it for, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Very good. Now will you kiss that Bible lying there, please, as a solemn oath that you did not - and you may go.\n\nNancy: Willingly, sir. (She does so, again with a little smile.) If I'd done it I'd've\n\nMr Manningham: That is all, Nancy. You may go.\n\nNancy exits\n\nMrs Manningham: (Picking up the Bible to put it back in its place) There! I think we may now be said to have demonstrated conclusively - -\n\nMrs Manningham: (rising) Give me that Bible! Give it to me! Let me kiss it, too! (She snatches itfrom him) There! (She kisses it) There! Do you see?\n\nMrs Manningham: (She kisses it) There! Do you see that I kiss it?\n\nMr Manningham: For God's sake be careful what you do. Do you desire to commit sacrilege above all else?\n\nMrs Manningham: It is no sacrilege, Jack. Someone else has committed sacrilege. Now see - I swear before God Almighty that I never touched that picture. (She kisses the Bible) There!\n\nMr Manningham: Then, by God, you are mad, and you don't know what you do. You unhappy wretch - you're stark gibbering mad - like your wretched mother before you.\n\nMrs Manningham: Jack - you promised you would never say that again.\n\nMr Manningham: (after a pause) The time has come to face facts, Bella. If this progresses you will not be much longer under my protection.\n\nMrs Manningham: Jack - I'm going to make a last appeal to you. I'm going to make a last appeal. I'm desperate, Jack. Can' t you see that I'm desperate? If you can't, you must have a heart of stone.\n\nMr Manningham: Go on. What do you wish to say?\n\nMrs Manningham: Jack, I may be going mad. like my poor mother - but if I am mad you have to treat me gently. Jack - before God - I never lie to you knowingly. If I have taken down that picture I have not known it. I have not known it. If I took it down on those other occasions I did not know it, either ... Jack, if I steal your things - your rings - your keys - your pencils and your handkerchiefs, and you find them later at the bottom of my box, as indeed you do, then I do not know that I have done it... Jack - if I commit these fantastic, meaningless mischiefs - so meaningless - why should I take a picture down from its place? If I do all these things, then I am certainly going off my head, and must be treated kindly and gently so that I may get well. You must bear with me, Jack, bear with me - not storm and rage. God knows I'm try ing. Jack, I'm try ing! Oh, for God's sake believe that I'm trying, and be kind to me!\n\nMr Manningham: Bella, my dear - have you any idea where that picture is now?\n\nMrs Manningham: Why, yes. I suppose it is behind the cupboard.\n\nMr Manningham: Will you please go and see?\n\nMrs Manningham: (vaguely) Yes ... Yes...\n\nMrs Manningham moves to the UL cupboard and produces the picture from behind the cupboard\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, it's here.\n\nMr Manningham: Then you did know where it was, Bella. You did know where it was.\n\nMrs Manningham: No! No! I only supposed it was! I only supposed it was because it was found there before! It was found there twice before. Don't you see? I didn 't know - I didn' t! (She moves towards him with the picture in her hand)\n\nMr Manningham: There is no sense in walking about the room with a picture in your hand, Bella. Go and put it back in its proper place.\n\nMrs Manningham hangs the picture on the wall, then moves L of the table\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, look at our tea ... We were having our tea with muffins ...\n\nMr Manningham: Now, Bella, I said a moment ago that we have got to face facts. And that is what we have got to do. I am not going to say anything at the moment for my feelings are running too high. In fact, I am going out immediately, and I suggest that you go to your room and lie down for a little in the dark.\n\nMrs Manningham: (moving DS of the table) No, no - not my room. For God's sake don't send me to my room!\n\nMr Manningham: There is no question of sending you to your room, Bella. You know perfectly well that you may do exactly as you please. Everything - -\n\nMrs Manningham: I feel faint, Jack ... I feel faint...\n\nMr Manningham: Very well... (He leads her to the settee) Now, take things quietly and come and sit down. Where are your salts? (He fetches a bottle of smelling salts from the cupboard) Here they are ... (He helps her with the salts. Pause) Now, my dear, I am going to leave you in peace ...\n\nMrs Manningham: (reclining, her eyes closed) Have you got to go? Must you go? Must you always leave me alone after these dreadful scenes?\n\nMr Manningham: Now, no argument, please. I had to go in any case after tea, and I am merely leaving a little earlier, that's all. (He puts on his hat and coat. Pause) Now, is there anything I can get for you?\n\nMrs Manningham: No, Jack dear, nothing. You go.\n\nMr Manningham: Very good ... (He moves to the door, and stops) Oh, by the way, I shall be passing the grocer and I might as well pay that bill of his and get it done with. Where is it, my dear? I gave it to you, didn't I?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, dear. It's on the desk. (Half-rising) I'll - -\n\nMr Manningham: No, dear - don't move - don't move. I can find it. (He moves to the bureau and rummages through it) I shall be glad to get the thing off my chest. Where is it, dear? Is it in on of these drawers?\n\nMrs Manningham: No - it's on top. I put it there this afternoon.\n\nMr Manningham: All right. We'll find it... We'll find it... Are you sure it's here, dear? There's nothing here except writing paper.\n\nMrs Manningham: (half-rising; suspiciously) Jack, I'm quite sure it is there. Will you look carefully?\n\nMr Manningham: (soothingly) All right, dear. Don't worry. Lie down. It's of no importance. We'll find it... No, it's not here ... It must be in one of the drawers ...\n\nMrs Manningham: It's not in one of the drawers! I put it out here on top!\n\n(She rushes to the bureau)\n\nMrs Manningham: You're not going to tell me this has gone, are you?\n\nMr Manningham: (simultaneously) My dear. Calm yourself. Calm yourself.\n\nMrs Manningham: (searching frantically) I laid it out here myself! Where is it? (Opening and shutting drawers) Where is it? Now you're going to say I've hidden this!\n\nMr Manningham: (walking away L) My God! What new trick is this you're playing upon me?\n\nMrs Manningham: It was there this afternoon! I put it there! This is a plot! This is a filthy plot! You're all against me! It's a plot! (She screams hysterically)\n\nMr Manningham: (coming to her and shaking her violently) Will you control yourself! Will you control yourself! Listen to me, madam, if you utter another sound I'll knock you down and take you to your room and lock you in darkness for a week. I have been too lenient with you, and I mean to alter my tactics.\n\nMrs Manningham: (sinking to her knees) Oh, God help me! God help me!\n\nMr Manningham: May God help you, indeed. Now listen to me. I am going to leave you until ten o'clock. In that time you will recover that paper, and admit to me that you have lyingly and purposely concealed it... If not, you will take the consequences. You are going to see a doctor, madam, more than one doctor - and they shall decide what this means. Now do you understand me?\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, God - be patient with me. If I am mad, be patient with me.\n\nMr Manningham: (moving to the door) I have been patient with you and controlled myself long enough. It is no w for you to control yourself, or take the consequences. Think upon that, Bella.\n\nMrs Manningham: Jack... Jack... Don't go ... Jack ... You're still going to take me to the theatre, aren't you?\n\nMr Manningham: What a question to ask me at such a time. No, madam, emphatically I am not. You play fair by me, and I'll play fair by you. If we are going to be enemies, you and I, you will find that it is I who shall get the best of it.\n\nMr Manningham exits\n\nMrs Manningham, whimpering, moves to the bureau and searches in the drawers, breaking down into sobs. She searches elsewhere in the room, holding her head and crying. At last she breaks down into sobbing upon the settee. Pause. She rises, goes to the little table, and takes some medicine. This is obviously incredibly nasty, and almost chokes her. She staggers. She goes over to the lamp and turns it down very low. She then moves back to the settee\n\nMrs Manningham: (whispering) God have mercy on me - God have mercy on me! (She puts up her feet and lies back, exhausted. She whispers the Lord's Prayer; then, muttering) \"Peace - peace - peace.\" (She breathes heavily)\n\nPause. There is a knock at the door. She does not hear it. There is another knock\n\nElizabeth enters\n\nElizabeth: Madam ... madam ...\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes!... Yes!... What is it. Elizabeth? Leave me alone.\n\nElizabeth: (peering through the darkness) Madam, there's somebody called.\n\nMrs Manningham: Who is it? I don't want to be disturbed.\n\nElizabeth: It's a gentleman, madam - he wants to see you.\n\nMrs Manningham: Tell him to go. Elizabeth. He wants to see my husband. My husband's out.\n\nElizabeth: No, madam - he wants to see you. You must see him, madam.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, leave me alone. Tell him to go away. I want to be left alone.\n\nElizabeth: Madam, madam. I don't know what's going on between you and the master, but you've got to hold up, madam. You've got to hold up.\n\nMrs Manningham: I am going out of my mind, Elizabeth. That's what's going on.\n\nElizabeth: Don't talk like that, madam. You've got to be brave. You mustn't go on lying here in the dark, or your mind will go. You must see this gentleman. It's you he wants - not the master. He's waiting below. Come, madam, it'll take you out of yourself.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, my God - what new torment is this? I'm not in a fit state, I tell you.\n\nElizabeth: Come, madam. I'll turn up the light. (She does so) There. Now you'll be all right.\n\nMrs Manningham: (sitting up on the settee) Elizabeth! What have you done? I can't have anyone in. I'm not fit to be seen.\n\nElizabeth: You look all right, madam. You mustn't take on so. Now - I'll call him up.\n\nElizabeth exits\n\nElizabeth: (Off) Will you come up, please, sir?\n\nMrs Manningham looks after Elizabeth, half-paralysed, then runs over to the mirror over the mantelpiece, and adjusts her hair. She stands with her back to the fireplace, waiting\n\nElizabeth returns, holding back the door\n\nEx-detective Rough enters. He is over sixty - greying, short, wiry, active, brusque, friendly, overbearing. He completely dominates the scene from his entrance\n\nRough: Thank you... Ah - good evening. (He moves to Mrs Manningham) Mrs Manningham, I believe ... How are you, Mrs Manningham?\n\nMrs Manningham: (shaking hands with Rough but not letting go of his hand) How do you do. I'm very much afraid ...\n\nRough: You're very much afraid you don't know me from Adam? That's about the root of the matter, isn't it?\n\nElizabeth exits, closing the door\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, no - it's not that - but no doubt you have come to see my husband?\n\nRough: (still holding her hand and looking at her appraisingly) Oh. no! You couldn't be further out. On the contrary, I have chosen this precise moment to call when I knew your husband was out. May I take off my things and sit down?\n\nMrs Manningham: Why, yes. I suppose you may.\n\nRough: You're a good deal younger and more attractive than I thought, you know. But you're looking very pale. Have you been crying?\n\nMrs Manningham: Really - I'm afraid I don't understand at all.\n\nRough: You will do so, madam, very shortly. (He moves L and removes his scarf during the following) You're the lady who's going off her head, aren't you?\n\nMrs Manningham: (moving towards him) What made you say that? Who are you? What have you come to talk about?\n\nRough: (taking off his coat and putting it on a chair) Well, of one thing you can be certain. I have not come to talk about the weather. Though that indeed merits a world of comment at the moment. But you're running away with things, Mrs Manningham, and asking me a good deal I can't answer at once. Instead of that, I am going to ask you a question or two ... Now, please, will you come here and give me your hands?\n\nThere is a pause. She obeys\n\nRough: Now, Mrs Manningham, I want you to take a good look at me, and see if you are not looking at someone to whom you can give your trust. I am a perfect stranger to you, and you can read little in my face besides that. But I can read a great deal in yours.\n\nMrs Manningham: (after a pause) What? What can you read in mine?\n\nRough: Why, madam. I can read the tokens of one who has travelled a very long way upon the path of sorrow and doubt - and will have, I fear, to travel a little further before she comes to the end. But I fancy she is coming towards the end, for all that. Come now. are you going to trust me, and listen to me? I'm old enough to be your grandfather.\n\nMrs Manningham: (after a pause) Who are you? God knows I need help.\n\nRough: I very much doubt whether God knows anything of the sort, Mrs Manningham. Had he done so I believe he would have come to your aid before this. But I am here, and so you must give me your faith.\n\nMrs Manningham: Who are you? Are you a doctor?\n\nRough: Nothing so learned, ma'am. Just a plain police detective.\n\nMrs Manningham: Police detective?\n\nRough: Yes. Or was ten years ago. At any rate, still detective enough to see that you've been interrupted in your tea. Couldn't you start again, and let me have a cup?\n\nMrs Manningham: Why, yes - yes. I will give you a cup. It only wants water. (She busies her self with hot water, cup, teapot, etcetera, throughout the ensuing conversation)\n\nRough: (fetching a chair and bringing it to the table) You never heard of the celebrated Sergeant Rough, madam? Sergeant Rough, who solved the Claudesley Diamond Case - Sergeant Rough, who hunted down the Camberwell Dogs - Sergeant Rough, who brought Sandham himself to justice ... (He puts his hand on the back of the chair, and looks at her) Or were all such sensations before your time?\n\nMrs Manningham: Sandham? Why, yes, I have heard of Sandham - the murderer, the throttler.\n\nRough: Yes, madam, Sandham the Throttler. And you are now looking at the man who gave Sandham to the man who throttled him. And that was the common hangman. In fact, Mrs Manningham, you have in front of you one who was quite a personage in his day - believe it or not.\n\nMrs Manningham: I quite believe it. Won't you sit down? I'm afraid it won' t be very hot.\n\nRough: Thank you... How long have you been married, Mrs Manningham?\n\nMrs Manningham: Seven years - and a little.\n\nRough: Where have you lived during all that time, Mrs Manningham?\n\nMrs Manningham: (putting milk in Rough's cup and passing it to him) Why ... First we went abroad - then we lived in Yorkshire, and then six months ago my husband took this house.\n\nRough: (taking the cup) Thank you ... And does your husband always leave you alone like this in the evenings?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. He goes to his club, I believe, and does business.\n\nRough: (stirring his tea; thoughtfully) So you believe.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes ...\n\nRough: And does your husband give you a free run of the whole house while he's out?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes ... Well, no... Not the top floor. Why do you ask?\n\nRough: Ah - not the top floor ...\n\nMrs Manningham: No... no... Will you have some sugar? What were you saying? (She sits, bending over eagerly to answer his questions)\n\nRough: Before I go any further, Mrs Manningham, I must tell you there's a leakage in this household. You have a maid called Nancy?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes ... Yes...\n\nRough: And Nancy walks out of an evening with a young man named Booker in my employ. I only live a few streets away from you, you know.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, yes?\n\nRough: Well, there is hardly anything which goes on in this house which is not described in detail to Booker, and from that quarter it reaches me.\n\nMrs Manningham: I knew it! I knew she talked. Now I know it, she shall be dismissed.\n\nRough: Oh, no - no such retribution is going to overtake her at the moment, Mrs Manningham. In fact, I fancy you are going to be heavily in debt to your maid, Nancy. If it were not for her indiscretions I should not be here now, should I?\n\nMrs Manningham: What do you mean? What is this mystery? You must not keep me in the dark. What is it?\n\nRough: I'm afraid I shall have to keep you in the dark for a little, Mrs Manningham, as I am still quite far down in the dark myself. Can I have another lump of sugar in this?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. (She passes the sugar bowl to him)\n\nRough: Thank you. We were talking about the top floor. (Helping himself to several lumps) There is a bedroom above this, and above that again is the top floor? Is that right?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes.\n\nRough: Now - have you ever been up to that top floor?\n\nMrs Manningham: No. Never ... It's shut up. My husband has forbidden it. No-one goes up there.\n\nRough: Not even a servant to dust.\n\nMrs Manningham: No.\n\nRough: Rather funny?\n\nMrs Manningham: (after a pause) Yes. (Pause) Yes, indeed ...\n\nRough: Yes. Now, Mrs Manningham, to ask a personal question: when did you first get the notion into your head that your reason was playing you tricks?\n\nMrs Manningham: (after a pause) How did you know?\n\nRough: Never mind how I know. How did it begin?\n\nMrs Manningham: I always had that dread. My mother died insane, when she was quite young. When she was my age. But only in the last six months, in this house - things began to happen - -\n\nRough: Which are driving you mad with fear?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. Which are driving me mad with fear.\n\nRough: Is it the house itself you fear, Mrs Manningham?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. I suppose it is. I hate the house. I always did.\n\nRough: And has the top floor got anything to do with it?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, yes, it has. How did you know? That's how all this dreadful horror began.\n\nRough: Ah - now you interest me beyond measure. Do tell me about the top floor.\n\nMrs Manningham: I don't know what to say. It all sounds incredible... It's when I'm alone at night. I get the idea that - somebody's walking about up there ... (Shepoints up) Up there ... At night, when my husband's out - I hear noises, from my bedroom, but I'm too afraid to go up ...\n\nRough: Have you told your husband about this?\n\nMrs Manningham: No. I'm afraid to. He gets angry. He says I imagine things which don't exist.\n\nRough: It never struck you, did it, that it might be your own husband walking about up there?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes - that is what I thought - but I thought I must be mad. Tell me how you knew.\n\nRough: Why not tell me first how you knew, Mrs Manningham.\n\nMrs Manningham: (rising and going towards the fireplace) It's true, then! I knew it. I knew it! When he leaves this house he comes back. He comes back and walks up there above - up and down - up and down. He comes back like a ghost. How does he get up there?\n\nRough: (rising and moving to Mrs Manningham) That's what we're going to find out, Mrs Manningham. But there are such commonplace resources as roofs and fire escapes, you know. Now please don't look so frightened. Your husband is no ghost, believe me, and you are very far from mad. Tell me now, what made you first think it was him?\n\nMrs Manningham: It was the light - the gaslight ... It went down and it went up ... Oh, thank God I can tell this to someone at last. I don't know who you are, but I must tell you.\n\nRough: Now try to keep calm. You can tell me just as well sitting down, can't you? Won't you sit down?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes ... yes. (She sits down on the settee)\n\nRough: (moving a small chair and sitting near her) The light, did you say? Did you see a light from a window?\n\nMrs Manningham: No. In this house, I can tell everything by the light of the gas. You see that mantle there? Now it's burning full. But if an extra light went on in the kitchen, or someone lit it in the bedroom, then this one would sink down. It's the same all over the house.\n\nRough: Yes - yes - that's just a question of insufficient pressure, and it's the same in mine. But go on, please.\n\nMrs Manningham: Every night, after he goes out, I find myself waiting for something. Then all at once I look round the room and see that the light is slowly going down. At first I tried not to notice it, but after a time it began to get on my nerves. I would go all over the house to see if anyone had put on an extra light, but they never had. It's always the same time - about ten minutes after he goes out. That's what made me think that somehow he had come back and that it was he who was walking about up there. I go up to the bedroom but I daren't stay there because I hear noises overhead. I want to scream and run out of the house. I sit here for hours, terrified, waiting for him to come back, and I always know when he's coming again. Suddenly the light goes up again and ten minutes afterwards I hear his key in the lock downstairs, and he's back again.\n\nRough: How very strange, indeed. You know. Mrs Manningham, you should have been a policeman.\n\nMrs Manningham: Are you laughing at me? Do you think I imagine everything too?\n\nRough: Oh no! I was merely praising the keenness of your observation. I not only think you are right in your suppositions, I think you have made a very remarkable discovery, and one which may have very far-reaching consequences.\n\nMrs Manningham: Far-reaching? How?\n\nRough: Well, let's leave it for the moment. Tell me, that is not the only cause, is it, which has lately given you reason to doubt your sanity? Has anything else been happening? Don't be afraid to tell me.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, there are other things. I hardly dare speak of them. It has been going on for so long. This business of the gas has only brought it to a head. It seems that my mind and memory are beginning to play me tricks.\n\nRough: Tricks? What sort of tricks? When?\n\nMrs Manningham: Incessantly - but more and more of late. He gives me things to look after, and when he asks for them they are gone, and can never be found. Then he misses his rings, or his studs, or his razors, and I will hunt the place for them, and he will find them lying hidden at the bottom of my work-box. Twice the door of that room was found locked with the key vanished. That was also found at the bottom of my box. Only today, before you came, that picture had been taken from the wall and hidden. Who could have done it but myself? I try to remember. I break my heart trying to remember. But I can't. Oh, and then there was that terrible business about the dog ...\n\nRough: The dog?\n\nMrs Manningham: We have a little dog. A few weeks ago, it was found with its paw hurt... He believes - oh God, how can I tell you what he believes - that I had hurt the dog. He does not let the dog near me now. He keeps it in the kitchen and I am not allowed to see it! I begin to doubt, don't you see? I begin to believe I imagine everything. Perhaps I do. Are you here? Is this a dream, too? Who are you? I'm afraid they are going to lock me up.\n\nRough: (putting his hands on hers) Do you know, Mrs Manningham, it has occurred to me that you'd be all the better for a little medicine.\n\nMrs Manningham: Medicine. Are you a doctor? You're not a doctor, are you?\n\nRough: No. I'm not a doctor, but that doesn't mean that a little medicine would do you any harm.\n\nMrs Manningham: But I have medicine. He makes me take it. It does me no good, and I hate it. How can medicine help a mind that's ill?\n\nRough: Oh - but mine'san exceptional medicine. I have some with me now. You must try it.\n\nMrs Manningham: What medicine is it?\n\nRough: You shall sample it and see. (He rises and goes over to his coat) You see, it has been employed by humanity, for several ages, for the purpose of the instantaneous removal of dark fears and doubt. That seems to fit you. doesn't it?\n\nMrs Manningham: The removal of doubt. How could a medicine effect that?\n\nRough: Ah - that we don'tknow.The fact remains that it does. Here we are. (He produces a bottle of whisky) You see, it comes from Scotland. Now, madam, have you such a thing handy as two glasses or two cups?\n\nMrs Manningham: Why - are you having some, too?\n\nRough: Oh yes. In fact, I am having some above all things. We could use these cups, if you like.\n\nMrs Manningham: No. I will get you ... (She goes to the cupboard and brings out two glasses)\n\nRough: Ah ... Thank you - the very thing. Now we shan't be long.\n\nMrs Manningham: What is it? I so dislike medicine. What does it taste like?\n\nRough: Delicious! Something between ambrosia and methylated spirits. Do you mean to say you've never tasted good Scotch whisky, Mrs Manningham?\n\nMrs Manningham: Whisky? But I must not take whisky. I can't do that!\n\nRough: (pouring two whiskies) You underestimate your powers, Mrs Manningham. You see, I don't want you thinking you can't trust your reason. This will give you faith in your reason like nothing else... Now for some water... All right, this will do. (He picks up the jug and pours water into Mrs Manningham's glass) There! (He hands the glass to her) Tell me - (pouring water into his own glass) did you ever hear of \"The Cabman's Friend\", Mrs Manningham?\n\nMrs Manningham: (smiling) \"The Cabman's Friend\"?\n\nRough: Yes. How nice to see you smile. Here's to your very good health. (He drinks) Go on ... There ... Is it so nasty?\n\nMrs Manningham: No. I rather like it. My mother used to give us this as children when we had the fever.\n\nRough: Ah, then you're a hardened whisky drinker. But you'11 enjoy it better sitting down.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. (Sitting down on the settee) What were you saying? Who is \"The Cabman's Friend\"?\n\nRough: Ah. \"The Cabman's Friend\". (He moves to the mantelpiece) You should ask me who was \"The Cabman's Friend\", Mrs Manningham, for she was an old lady who died many, many years ago. (He puts his whisky on the mantelpiece)\n\nMrs Manningham: An old lady years ago? What has she to do with me?\n\nRough: A great deal, I fancy, if you will follow me patiently. Her name was Barlow - Alice Barlow, and she was an old lady of great wealth, and decided eccentricities. In fact, her principal mania in life was the protection of cabmen. You may think that an extraordinary hobby, but in her odd way she did a lot of good. She provided these men with shelters, clothing, pensions, and so forth, and that was her little contribution to the sum of the world's happiness, or rather her little stand against the sum of the world's pain. There is a great deal of pain in this world, Mrs Manningham, you know. Well, it was not my privilege to know her, but it was my duty, on just one occasion, to see her. That was when her throat was cut open, and she lay dead on the floor of her own house.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, how horrible! Do you mean she was murdered?\n\nRough: Yes. She was murdered. I was only a comparatively young officer at the time, but it made an extremely horrible, in fact I may say lasting, impression on me. The murderer was never discovered but the motive was obvious enough. The Barlow Rubies had been inherited by her, and it was well known that she kept them, without any proper precautions, in her bedroom on an upper floor. She lived alone except for a deaf servant in the basement. Well, for that she paid the penalty of her life.\n\nMrs Manningham: But what - - ?\n\nRough: There were some sensational features about the case. The man seemed to have got in at about ten at night and stayed till dawn. Apart, presumably, from the jewels, there were only a few trinkets taken, but the whole house had been turned upside down, and in the upper room every single thing was flung about, or torn open. Even the cushions of the chairs were ripped up with his bloody knife, and the police decided that it must have been a revengeful maniac as well as a robber. I had other theories but I was a nobody then, and not in charge of the case.\n\nMrs Manningham: What were your theories?\n\nRough: Well, it seemed to me, from all that I gathered here and there, that the old lady might have been an eccentric, but that she was by no means a fool. It seemed to me that she might have been one too clever for that man. We presume he killed her to silence her, but what then? What if she had not been so careless? What if she had got those jewels hidden away in some inconceivably cunning place, in the walls, floored down, bricked in, maybe? What if the only person who could tell him where they were was lying dead on the floor! Would not that account, Mrs Manningham, for all the strange confusion in which the place was found. Can't you picture him. Mrs Manningham, searching through the night, ransacking the place, hour after hour, growing more and more desperate, until at last the dawn comes and he has to slink out into the pale street, the blood and wreckage of the night behind. And the deaf servant down in the basement sleeping like a dog through it all.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, how horrible! How horrible indeed. And was the man ever found?\n\nRough: No, Mrs Manningham, the man was never found. Nor has the Barlow jewellery ever come to light.\n\nMrs Manningham: Then perhaps he found it after all. and may be alive today.\n\nRough: I think he is almost certainly alive today, but I don't believe he found what he wanted. That is, if my theory is right.\n\nMrs Manningham: Then the jewels may still be where the old lady hid them?\n\nRough: Indeed, Mrs Manningham, if my theory is right, the jewels must still be where she hid them, but then, of course, it was only a theory and that formed in quite a young man, long enough ago. The official conclusion was quite otherwise. The police, naturally and quite excusably presumed that the murderer had got them, and there was no re-opening of matters in those days. Soon enough the public forgot about it. I forgot about it myself. But it would be funny, wouldn't it, Mrs Manningham, if after all these years I should turn out to be right.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, yes, indeed. But what has this to do with me?\n\nRough: Ah, that is the whole question, Mrs Manningham. What, indeed? What has the obscure murder of an old lady twenty years ago to do with an attractive, though I am afraid at present somewhat pale and wan young lady in this house, who believes she is going out of her mind, and watches the gaslight going up and down when her husband is out at night? Well, I believe there is a link, however remote, wild and strange it may be, and that is why I am here.\n\nMrs Manningham: It's all so confusing. Won't you - -\n\nRough: Do you conceive it possible, Mrs Manningham, that that man might not have given up hope of one day getting at the treasure which lay there, and have bided his time until he could somehow re-enter the house?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. Yes. Possibly. But how - - ?\n\nRough: Can you conceive that he may have waited years - five years, ten years, fifteen years, twenty years even - time in which he may have done many things: gone abroad, got married even, until at last his chance came to resume the search begun on that terrible night? You don't follow where I am leading at all, do you, Mrs Manningham?\n\nMrs Manningham: Follow you? Yes, I think so.\n\nRough: You know, Mrs Manningham, of the old theory that the criminal always returns to the scene of his crime. Ah, yes, but in this case there is something more than morbid compulsion. There is treasure there to be unearthed if only he can search again, search methodically, without fear of interruption, without causing suspicion. And how would he do that? Don't you think ...\n\nThe gaslights begin to fade\n\nMrs Manningham rises suddenly\n\nRough: What's the matter, Mrs Manningham?\n\nMrs Manningham: Quiet! Be quiet! He has come back! Look! Look at the light! It is going down! Wait!\n\nThere is a pause. The gaslights sink further\n\nMrs Manningham: There! He has come back, you see. He is upstairs now.\n\nRough: (moving to the window) Dear me, now. How very odd that is. How very odd, indeed.\n\nMrs Manningham: He is in the house, I tell you. You must go. He will know you are here. You must go.\n\nRough: How dark it is. You could hardly see to read.\n\nMrs Manningham: You must go. He is in the house. Please go.\n\nRough: (moving to her) Quiet, Mrs Manningham, quiet! You have got to keep your head. Don't you see my meaning, yet? Don't you understand that this was the house?\n\nMrs Manningham: House? What house?\n\nRough: The old woman's house, Mrs Manningham. This house, here, these rooms, these walls. Twenty years ago Alice Barlow lay dead in this room. Twenty years ago the man who murdered her ransacked this house - below and above - but could not find what he sought. What if he is still searching, Mrs Manningham? What if he is up there - still searching? Now do you see why you must keep your head?\n\nMrs Manningham: But my husband, my husband is up there!\n\nRough: Precisely that, Mrs Manningham. Your husband. (He fetches the glass of whiskyfrom the mantelpiece) You see, I am afraid you are married to a tolerantly dangerous gentleman. Now drink this quickly, as we have a great deal to do. (He holds out the glass to her)\n\nMrs Manningham remains motionless\n\nMrs Manningham takes the whisky from Rough in a mechanical way, and stares at him\n\nMrs Manningham: This house ... How do you know this was the house?\n\nRough: Why, ma'am, because I was on the case, and came here myself, that's all.\n\nMrs Manningham: The idea is mad, mad. I have been married seven years. How can you imagine my husband is - what you imagine he may be?\n\nRough: Mrs Manningham ...\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes?\n\nPause\n\nRough: (pouring himself another whisky) When the police came into this place twenty years ago, as you can understand there was a lot of routine work to be done - interviewing of relatives and friends and so forth. Most of that was left to me.\n\nMrs Manningham: Well?\n\nRough: Well, amongst all the acquaintances and relatives, nephews and nieces, et cetera, that I interviewed, there happened to be a young man by the name of Sydney Power. I suppose you have never heard that name at all, have you?\n\nMrs Manningham: Power?\n\nRough: Yes. Sydney Power. It conveys nothing to you?\n\nMrs Manningham: Sydney Power. No ...\n\nRough: Well, he was a kind of distant cousin apparently much attached to the old lady, and even assisting her in her good works. The only thing was that I remembered his face. Well. I saw that face again about five weeks ago. It took me a whole day to discover where I had seen it before, but I remembered it at last.\n\nMrs Manningham: Well - what of it? What if you did remember him?\n\nRough: It was not so much my remembering Mr Sydney Power, Mrs Manningham. What startled me was the lady on his arm, and the locality in which I saw him.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh - who was the lady on his arm?\n\nRough: You were the lady on his arm, Mrs Manningham, and you were walking down this street.\n\nMrs Manningham: What are you saying? Do you mean you think my husband - my husband is this Mr Power?\n\nRough: Well, not exactly, for if my theories are right - -\n\nMrs Manningham: What are you saying? You stand there talking riddles. You are so cold. You are as heartless and cold as he is.\n\nRough: (moving to her) No, Mrs Manningham, I am not cold, and I am not talking riddles. I am just trying to preserve a cold and calculating tone, because you are up against the most awful moment in your life, and your whole future depends on what you are going to do in the next hour. Nothing less. You have got to strike for your freedom, and strike now, for the moment may not come again.\n\nMrs Manningham: Strike - -\n\nRough: You are not going out of your mind, Mrs Manningham, you are slowly, methodically, systematically being driven out of your mind. And why? Because you are married to a criminal maniac who is afraid you are beginning to know too much - a criminal maniac who steals back to his own house at night, still searching for something he could not find twenty years ago. Those are the facts, wild and incredible as they may seem. His name is no more Manningham than mine is. He is Sydney Power and he murdered Alice Barlow in this house. He changed his name, and he has waited all these years, until he found it safe to acquire this house in a legal way. He then acquired the empty house next door. Every night, for the last few weeks, he has entered that house from the back, climbed up on to its roof and come into this house by the skylight. I know that because I have seen him do it. You have watched the gaslight, and been aware of the same thing. He is up there now. Why he should employ this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting at what he wants, God himself only knows. For the same reason, perhaps, that he employs this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting rid of you: that is by slowly driving you mad and sending you into a lunatic asylum. Thank God you are not married to him, and that I have come here to save you from the workings of his wicked mind.\n\nMrs Manningham: Not married? Not married? He married me.\n\nRough: I have no doubt he did, Mrs Manningham. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, he contracted the same sort of union with another lady many years before he met you. Moreover the lady is still alive, and the English law has a highly exacting taste in monogamy. You see, I have been finding things out about Mr Sydney Power.\n\nMrs Manningham: Are you speaking the truth? My God - are you speaking the truth? Where is his wife now?\n\nRough: If my guesses are right, she is the length of the world away - on the continent of Australia to be precise, where I know for a fact he spent five years. Did you know that?\n\nMrs Manningham: No. I did not know that.\n\nRough: Ah, yes. If only I could find her, everything would be easier, and that's the whole root of the matter, Mrs Manningham. So far I am only dealing in guesses and half facts. I have got to have evidence, and that is why I came to see you. You have got to give me the evidence or help me find it.\n\nMrs Manningham: This is my husband. Don't you understand - this is my husband. He married me. Do you ask me to betray the man who married me?\n\nRough: By which you mean, of course, the man who has betrayed you into thinking that you are married to him - don't you?\n\nMrs Manningham: But I'm married to him. You must go. I must think this out. You must go. I must cling to the man I married. Mustn't I?\n\nRough: Indeed, cling to him by all means, but do not imagine you are the only piece of ivy. You can cling to him if you desire, as his fancy women cling to him in the low resorts of the town. That is the sort of wall you have to cling to, ma'am.\n\nMrs Manningham: Women? What are you suggesting?\n\nRough: I'm not suggesting anything. I am only telling you what I have seen. He comes to life at night, this gentleman upstairs, in more ways than one. I have made it my business to follow him on some of his less serious excursions, and I can promise you he has a taste in unemployed actresses which he is at no pains to conceal.\n\nMrs Manningham: (after a pause) Is this the truth? Are you telling me the truth?\n\nRough: Mrs Manningham - will you look me in the eyes again, and see if you think I am telling you the truth?\n\nMrs Manningham: (after a pause) Yes. I have known it. How strange that is ... I have known it all along ...\n\nRough: Mrs Manningham, it is hard to take everything from you, but you are no more tied to this man. you are under no more obligation to him than those wretched women in those places. You must learn to be thankful for that.\n\nMrs Manningham: What do you want me to do? What do you want?\n\nRough: (completely changing his tone, striding up and down in a business like way) I want his papers, Mrs Manningham - his identity. There is some clue somewhere in this house, and we have got to get at it. Where does he keep his papers?\n\nMrs Manningham: Papers? I know of no papers. Unless his bureau ...\n\nRough: Yes. His bureau? His bureau?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. There. (She points to the bureau) But he keeps it always locked. I have never seen it open.\n\nRough: Ah - he keeps it always locked, does he?\n\nMrs Manningham: It is just his desk - his bureau ...\n\nRough: (moving L) Very well. We will have a look inside.\n\nMrs Manningham: But it is locked. How can you, if it is locked?\n\nRough: Oh - it doesn't look so formidable. (He fetches a ring of keys and implementsfrom his overcoat pocket during the following) You know, Mrs Manningham, one of the greatest regrets of my life is that fate never made me one of two things: one was a gardener, the other a burglar - both quiet occupations, Mrs Manningham. As for the last, if I'd started young, and worked my way up, I should have been a genius. Now let's have a look at this.\n\nMrs Manningham: But you must not touch this. He will know what you have done.\n\nRough: Come now, ma'am. You're working with me, aren't you - not against me? (He looks at the bureau) Yes ... Yes... Now do you mind if I take off my coat? I'm a man who never feels at work until his coat's off. (He takes off his jacket, revealing a pink fancy shirt) Quite a saucy shirt, don't you think? You didn 't suspect I was such a dandy, did you? Now. (He goes over to the bureau) Let's have a real look at this.\n\nThere is a pause. During the following, the gaslights slowly brighten again\n\nMrs Manningham: But you must not tamper with that. He will know what you have done.\n\nRough: Not if we are clever enough. And this one here doesn't even ask for cleverness ... You see, Mrs Manningham, there are all manner of\n\nMrs Manningham: Stop ... Stop talking ... Haven't you noticed? Haven't you noticed something?\n\nRough: Noticed? I've only - -\n\nMrs Manningham: Stop! Yes... I was right. Look. Can't you see? The light! It's going up. He's coming back.\n\nRough: The light?\n\nMrs Manningham: Quiet!\n\nThere is a pause, after which the gaslights slowly return to their full brightness in a tense silence\n\nMrs Manningham: There. Don't you see, it's come back. You must go. He's coming back. Don't you see ... He's coming back and you must go!\n\nRough: God bless my soul. This looks as if the unexpected has entered in, and our plans are going awry.\n\nMrs Manningham: He always does the unexpected. I never know what he'll do. You must go.\n\nRough: (looking up ruminatively, without moving) I wonder. Yes. Well, well ... (He begins to put on his jacket) Now - please - will you go and ring that bell for Elizabeth.\n\nMrs Manningham: Elizabeth. Why do you want her?\n\nRough: Do as I say, and ring the bell. At once, please.\n\nRough gets his overcoat from the chair and his keys from the bureau\n\nRough: Or you can go and fetch her if you like. Now let me see.\n\nMrs Manningham: (ringing the bell) Oh, what shall I do? What shall I say to him? You must go at once. Why do you want Elizabeth?\n\nRough: (putting on his overcoat) All in good time. He's not going to jump through the window, you know. In fact he can't be round at our front door in less than five minutes - unless he's a magician. Now can you see anything that I've missed?\n\nMrs Manningham: No. No. Yes, the whisky here. (She hands him the bottle)\n\nRough: Oh, yes. I told you you'd make a good policeman. Don't forget the glasses.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, do go, please, please go.\n\nElizabeth enters. Mrs Manningham puts the glasses away\n\nRough: Ah ... Elizabeth ... Come here will you?\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir?\n\nRough: Elizabeth, you and I have got to do a little quite calm, but rather quick, thinking. Are you anxious to help your mistress, Elizabeth?\n\nElizabeth: Why, yes, sir, I told you I was, sir. But what's it all about?\n\nRough: Are you anxious to help your mistress, blindly, without asking any questions?\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir. But you see - -\n\nRough: (kindly taking her hand) Come now, Elizabeth. Are you or are you not?\n\nElizabeth: (after a pause, in a quiet voice) Yes, sir.\n\nRough: Good. Now, Elizabeth, Mrs Manningham and I have reason to suppose that in about five minutes' time the master is returning to this house. I do not think it is advisable to leave the house at the moment, as I might be seen doing so by the master. Would you be good enough to take me down to your kitchen and hide me away for a short space of time? You can put me in the oven if you like.\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir. But you see - -\n\nMrs Manningham: You must go. You must go. He won't see you if you go now.\n\nRough: What were you saying, Elizabeth?\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir. You could come to the kitchen. But... Nancy's down there, sir.\n\nRough: Nancy! What the devil's this, then? I thought this was Nancy's afternoon off. Was it not arranged that I should come when Nancy was away?\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir. But for some reason she's stayed on. I think she's got a young man, and I couldn't make her go, could I, sir? If I'd done that, I'd've - -\n\nRough: All right... all right. Then she was here when I came, and she knows I am here - is that it?\n\nElizabeth: Oh, no ... She was in the scullery when I answered the door, and I said it was a man who had come to the wrong house. She hasn't no idea, sir, and I'm - -\n\nRough: All right. All right. That's better news. But it means you can't entertain me in the kitchen. (He goes to the window) Now where are you going to hide me, Elizabeth? Make up your mind quickly, as time is getting rather short.\n\nElizabeth: I don't know, sir. Unless you go to the bedroom. Mine and Nancy's, I mean.\n\nRough: That sounds altogether entrancing! Shall we go there now?\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir, but supposing Nancy went up there before she goes out?\n\nRough: You think of everything, Elizabeth, and you're a good soul. (He moves to the door UR) Where does this lead to. and what's the matter with this?\n\nElizabeth: It's where he dresses, where he keeps his clothes. Yes, sir. Go in there, sir. He won't see you there. There's a big wardrobe there, at the back.\n\nRough: (going again to the window and looking out briefly) Excuse me.\n\nRough exits into the room UR\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth: It's all right, ma'am. Don't take on so. It'll be all right.\n\nMrs Manningham: I'm sure he ought to go.\n\nElizabeth: No, ma'am. He knows best. He's bound to know best.\n\nRough enters from the room UR\n\nRough: Perfect accommodation. (He goes to the window for another peep. He sees something) Yes, there he is. Now we really have got to hurry. Get off to bed, Mrs Manningham, quick. And you, Elizabeth, go to your room. You can't get downstairs in time. Hurry, please. Elizabeth, turn down that lamp. (He turns down the gaslights during the following)\n\nElizabeth turns down the lamp\n\nMrs Manningham: To bed? Am I to go to bed?\n\nRough: (really excited for the first time) Yes, quick. He's coming. Don't you understand. Go there and stay there. Take her, Elizabeth. You have a bad headache - a bad headache. (Turning from the gaslight; quite angrily) Will you take her, in heaven's name!\n\nMrs Manningham and Elizabeth exit UL, leaving the door half open; light spills in from the passage outside\n\nRough opens the door wider and watches the women ascend. He looks over the landing. He comes back and listens in the doorway. He goes over to the window and peeps through the curtains. He comes again to the door UL and stands rigidly in the doorway, listening intently. After a pause there is the sound of the front door slamming. He stiffens. He still listens. Pause\n\nAll at once, he all but closes the door, goes over to the door UR, and exits, shutting the door silently\n\nPause\n\nMr Manningham opens the UL door and puts his head into the room. He comes in and shuts the door\n\nThe stage is almost completely dark now\n\nThere is a pause.Then Mr Manningham can be heard moving a chair. He reaches the gaslights, and turns them up. He looks around in a decidedly suspicious way. He takes off his gloves and looks at the tea things. He goes and rings the bell, whistling to himself. He takes off his hat and overcoat in a leisurely way, dusting his trousers\n\nElizabeth enters\n\nElizabeth: Did you ring, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Yes, I did.\n\nMr Manningham, without saying why he has rung, places his hat and overcoat over a chair and then comes and stands with his back to the fireplace\n\nMr Manningham: Where is Mrs Manningham, Elizabeth?\n\nElizabeth: I think she's gone to bed, sir. I think she had a bad headache and went to bed.\n\nMr Manningham: Oh, indeed. And how long has the good lady been in bed, do you know?\n\nElizabeth: She went just a little while ago, sir - I think, sir - -\n\nMr Manningham: Oh. I see. Then we must be quiet, mustn't we? Walk about like cats ... Can you walk about like a cat, Elizabeth?\n\nElizabeth: (trying to smile) Yes, sir. I think so, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: Very well, Elizabeth. Walk about like a cat. All right. That's all.\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. (She heads for the door)\n\nMr Manningham comes to the table and makes to take off his jacket\n\nElizabeth exits; she nearly gets the door closed behind her\n\nMr Manningham: Er - Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth enters\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir?\n\nMr Manningham is again silent\n\nElizabeth: Did you call, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Yes. Why haven't you cleared away the tea things?\n\nElizabeth: Oh - I'm sorry, sir. I was really just about to, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: I think you had better clear away the tea things, Elizabeth.\n\n(He now definitely takes off his jacket)\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir.\n\nMr Manningham and puts his jacket carefully over a chair. He undoes his tie\n\nElizabeth: (After a pause, putting a dish on the tray) Excuse me, sir, but were you going to have some supper, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Oh, yes. I am going to have supper. The question is, am I going to have supper here?\n\nElizabeth: Oh, yes, sir. Are you having it out, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Yes, I am having it out. I have come back to change my linen. (He undoes his collar)\n\nThere is a pause\n\nElizabeth: (stopping again) Do you want a fresh collar, sir? Shall I get you a fresh collar?\n\nMr Manningham: Why, do you know where my collars are kept?\n\nElizabeth: Why yes, sir. In your room, there, sir. Shall I get you one, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: What a lot you know, Elizabeth. And do you know the sort of collar I want tonight?\n\nElizabeth: Why, yes, sir ... I think I know the sort of collar, sir ...\n\nMr Manningham: Then all I can say is you know a great deal more than I do ... No ... I think you must let me choose my own collar ... (He moves towards the door R and stops) That is, if I have your permission, Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth: (gazing at him) Yes, sir ... yes, sir ...\n\nMr Manningham exits into the room UR\n\nElizabeth puts on the table the plate she is holding and lowers her head, remaining motionless in suspense. Not a sound comes from the other room, and nearly a quarter of a minute goes by\n\nMr Manningham enters in a perfectly leisurely way. During the following, he puts his tie on and looks at himself in the mirror over the mantelpiece\n\nMr Manningham: What did you think about Mrs Manningham tonight, Elizabeth?\n\nElizabeth: Mrs Manningham, sir? In what way do you mean, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Oh - just as regards her general health, Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth: I don't know, sir. She certainly seems very unwell.\n\nMr Manningham: Yes. I doubt if you guess to what extent she is unwell. Or are you beginning to guess?\n\nElizabeth: I don't know, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: I'm afraid I was compelled to drag you and Nancy into our troubles tonight. Perhaps I should not have done that.\n\nElizabeth: It all seems very sad, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: (smiling; somewhat appealingly) I'm at my wits' end, Elizabeth. Don't you know that?\n\nElizabeth: I expect you are, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: I have tried everything. Kindness, patience, cunning - even harshness, to bring her to her senses. But nothing will stop these wild, wild hallucinations, nothing will stop these wicked pranks and tricks.\n\nElizabeth: It seems very terrible, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: You don't know a quarter of it, Elizabeth. You only see what is forced upon your attention - as it was tonight. You have no conception of what goes on all the time. (He looks at his tie) No - not this one, I think ... (He undoes if)\n\nElizabeth: Do you want another tie, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Yes.\n\nMr Manningham strolls again into the room UR, and after a pause, comes out with another tie. He ties it during the ensuing conversation\n\nMr Manningham: I suppose you know about Mrs Manningham's mother, Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth: No, sir. What of her, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Not of the manner in which she died?\n\nElizabeth: No, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: She died in the mad-house, Elizabeth, without any brain at all in the end.\n\nElizabeth: Oh, sir! How terrible, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: Yes, terrible indeed. The doctors could do nothing. (Pause) You know, don't you, that I shall have to bring a doctor to Mrs Manningham before long, Elizabeth? I have fought against it to the last, but it can't be kept a secret much longer.\n\nElizabeth: No, sir ... no, sir ...\n\nMr Manningham: I mean to say, you know what goes on. You can testify to what goes on, can't you?\n\nElizabeth: Indeed, sir. Yes.\n\nMr Manningham: Indeed, you may have to testify in the end. Do you realize that?\n\nPause\n\nMr Manningham: Eh?\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir. I would only wish to help you both, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: (putting on his jacket, hat and coat) Yes, I believe you there, Elizabeth. You're a very good soul. I sometimes wonder how you put up with things in this household - this dark household. I wonder why you do not go. You're very loyal.\n\nElizabeth looks at Mr Manningham in an extraordinary way. He cannot see her\n\nElizabeth: Always loyal to you, sir. Always loyal to you.\n\nMr Manningham: There now, how touching. I thank you, Elizabeth. You will be repaid later for what you have said, and repaid in more ways than one. You understand that, don't you?\n\nElizabeth: Thank you, sir. I only want to serve, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: Yes, I know that. Well, Elizabeth, I am going out. In fact, I' m even going to try and be a little gay. Can you understand that, or do you think it is wrong?\n\nElizabeth: Oh, no, sir. No. You should get what pleasure you can, sir, while you can.\n\nMr Manningham: I wonder... Yes... I wonder - it's a curious existence, isn't it? Well - good-night, Elizabeth. (He heads for the door)\n\nElizabeth: Good-night, sir... Good-night.\n\nMr Manningham exits, closing the door\n\nThere is a pause\n\nRough enters\n\nRough and Elizabeth stand there looking at each other; at last Rough goes to the window and looks out. The front door is heard slamming\n\nRough: He was right when he said you would be repaid, Elizabeth. Though not in the way he thinks. (He takes off his overcoat. Pause) Will you go and get Mrs Manningham?\n\nElizabeth: Yes, sir. I'll get her, sir. (She picks up the tray and heads for the exit)\n\nRough gets his implements out of his overcoat pocket Mrs Manningham enters, meeting Elizabeth at the door\n\nRough: Ah - there you are.\n\nMrs Manningham: I saw him go.\n\nRough: Now we must get back to work.\n\nMrs Manningham: What did he want? What did he come back for?\n\nRough: He only came back to change his clothes. Turn up the lamp, will you?\n\n(He moves to the bureau)\n\nMrs Manningham turns up the lamp, then joins Rough at the bureau\n\nRough: Now let's have another look at this.\n\nMrs Manningham: What if he comes back again? There is no light to warn us now.\n\nRough: Oh, you've realized that, have you? Well, Mrs Manningham, we've just got to take that risk. This is going to be child's play, I fancy. Just a little patience - a little adroitness in the use - -\n\nThe front door is heard to slam\n\nRough: What's that? Go and have a look, will you? We seem to be rather bothered this evening, don't we?\n\nMrs Manningham runs over to the window\n\nMrs Manningham: It's all right. It's only Nancy. I forgot. She usually goes out at this time.\n\nRough: She uses the front door - does she?\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, yes. Indeed she does. She behaves like a mistress in this house.\n\nRough: A saucy girl. (He opens the top of the bureau) Ah - here we are. Next to a key there's nothing a lock appreciates like kindness.\n\nMrs Manningham: Will you be able to close it again?\n\nRough: Yes. No damage done yet. Now. Let's see. (He looks into a drawer) Doesn't seem much here ... And when she got there the cupboard was bare - (he picks up a piece of paper) and so the poor detective - -\n\nMrs Manningham: What is that in your hand? Let me see. Let me see. (She takes the piece of paper from him)\n\nRough: Just a bill, I fancy.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. As you say. Just a bill. Just a grocer's bill. (Pause) You must forgive me if I doubted you at first, Inspector. You are right. He must be the wickedest man on earth.\n\nRough: Now I'm afraid you're one ahead of me, Mrs Manningham.\n\nMrs Manningham: This bill. This evening he went storming out of the house because he had given it to me, and it had disappeared. He threatened me with the mad-house if it did not come to light. I am beginning to understand, I think, at last.\n\nRough: Really now. (He takes the bill from her) Well, well, the essence of a good trick is its simplicity, isn't it?\n\nMrs Manningham: Is there anything else there? What else is there? Yes, look, my watch! And my brooch - my brooch. (Shepicks up a watch and brooch from the drawer) Look at these. My God, look at these! (She pulls the drawer out of the bureau and takes it to the table)\n\nRough: These are your property also, then?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. Both of them. This watch I lost a week ago - my brooch has been missing three months. And he said he would give me no more gifts because I lost them. He said that in my wickedness I hid them away. Oh, Inspector, you have indeed found treasure tonight.\n\nRough: (going to a drawer at the side of the bureau) Not very much at present, I'm afraid - at least not very much to the point. Ah, yes, this is locked\n\nMrs Manningham: (finding another bit of paper and reading it) One moment... One moment... (Still reading it, she sits down L of the table) This is from my cousin - my cousin - -\n\nRough: Is his correspondence with your relations very much to the point at the moment, Mrs Manningham?\n\nMrs Manningham: You don't understand. (Rapidly) You don't understand. When I was married I was cast off by all my relations. I have not seen any of them ever since I have been married. They did not approve my choice. I have longed to see them again more than anything else in the world. When we came to London - to this house, I wrote to them. I wrote to them twice. There was never any answer. Now I see why I had no answer. This letter is from my cousin.\n\nRough: Ah, yes, I see. Just another little - -\n\nMrs Manningham: Listen. Let me read you what he says. Let me read it to you. (Reading) \"Dear Cousin... All of us were overjoyed to hear from you again.\" Overjoyed, do you hear that? He goes on to say that his family are in Devonshire, that they have gone to the country. He says we must meet and recapture old times ... (She shows signs of emotion) He says that they all want to see me... He says he is sorry I have not been well - that I must go and stay with them - that they will give me ... that they will give me - their Devonshire cream to fatten my cheeks, and their fresh air to bring the sparkle back to my eyes... They will give me... (Breaking down) Dear heaven, they wanted me back! They wanted me back all the time! (She cries softly)\n\nRough: (moving to Mrs Manningham) Poor thing. Poor thing. You shall have your Devonshire cream, my dear, and you shall have your fresh air to bring the sparkle back into your eyes. Why, I can see a sparkle in them already. If you will be brave now, you will not have to wait so long. Are you going to be brave?\n\nMrs Manningham: Thank you, Inspector, for bringing me this letter. What do you want me to do now?\n\nRough: Oh, just stand by for the moment, Mrs Manningham. Tell me. (Indicating the side drawer) This drawer here. Has it ever been open to your knowledge?\n\nMrs Manningham: No.\n\nRough: No? I suspected as much ... Yes. This is a tougher proposition, I'm afraid. (He goes to his overcoat and produces an iron instrument)\n\nMrs Manningham: (rising to stop him) What are you going to do? Are you going to force it?\n\nRough: If I possibly can. I don't know that - -\n\nMrs Manningham: But you must not do that. You mustn't. What shall I say when he comes back?\n\nRough: I have no idea what you will say when he comes back, Mrs Manningham. But then I have no idea what you will do when he comes back, Mrs Manningham, if I have no evidence to remove you from his loving care for good.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh. God. I am afraid. What can I do?\n\nRough: There is only one thing we can do - go ahead. If we go back now, we are lost. I am going to force it and gamble on finding something. Are you with me?\n\nMrs Manningham: But don't you see... All right. Force it. Force it. But be quick.\n\nRough: (working on the lock) There's no hurry, ma'am. He's quite happy where he is... Now I don't like - (straining at the lock) violent methods - of this sort - it makes me feel like a dentist... There ...\n\nThere is a sound of splitting wood from the side drawer\n\nRough: All over now ... Now, let's have a look. (He looks through the contents of the side drawer)\n\nThere is a pause. Mrs Manningham watches Rough\n\nMrs Manningham: Is there anything in there? Is there anything there?\n\nRough: Nothing at present, I' m afraid... Nothing at present... Wait a minute ... No ... No ... (Looking at a document) What's this?\n\nMrs Manningham: Is there nothing?\n\nRough: (looking more closely) One moment... No ... Not a thing. We have lost our gamble, ma'am, I'm afraid.\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, dear. What are we to do?\n\nRough: Some rapid thinking at the moment. Don't have any fear, Mrs Manningham, I've been in many a tighter corner than this. Let's get these things back to begin with, shall we? Give me the watch and the brooch. We must put them back where they were.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes - here they are. (She hands the watch, brooch and letter to him)\n\nRough: Thank you ... Thank you ... Now, we must remember where they went. (He looks into the drawer on the table) Here on the right, was it not?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. There ... That's right. There.\n\nRough: (holding up the brooch) A nice piece of jewellery. When did he give you that?\n\nMrs Manningham: Soon after we were married. But it was only second hand.\n\nRough: Secondhand, eh? I'm afraid you got everything secondhand from this gentleman, Mrs Manningham. (He places the watch, brooch and letter back in the drawer on the tob/e) Well - that's all right, I think. Now I must lock this up again, if I can ... (He puts the drawer back into its place and starts to shut the top of the bureau, but stops) Secondhand... How did you know that piece of jewellery was secondhand, Mrs Manningham?\n\nMrs Manningham: There's an affectionate inscription to someone else inside.\n\nRough: (vaguely) Oh ... Is there? ... Why didn't you tell me that?\n\nMrs Manningham: Why - I only found it myself a little while ago.\n\nRough: Oh - really ... (He opens the bureau and takes out the brooch) Do you know, I have afeeling I have seen this somewhere before. Where is this inscription you speak of?\n\nMrs Manningham: It is a sort of trick. I only discovered it by accident. You pull the pin at the back out. It goes to the right, and then to the left. It opens out like a star.\n\nRough: (following thse instructions) Oh, yes ... Yes ... Ah ... here we are. Yes. (He opens out the brooch) How very odd. What are these spaces here?\n\nMrs Manningham: There were some beads in it, but they were all loose and falling out - so I took them out.\n\nRough: Oh... There were some beads in it, but they were all loose and falling out - so you took them out. Have you got them, by any chance?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. I think so. I put them in a vase.\n\nRough: May I see them, please?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. (Moving to the vase on the mantelpiece) They should still be here.\n\nRough: There should be nine altogether, I think.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, that's right, I think there were. (Shepicks up the vase and tips several red gems tones out of it) Yes ... Here they are. Here are some of them at any rate.\n\nRough: Let me see, will you?\n\nMrs Manningham hands the stones to Rough\n\nRough: Ah ... Thank you ... Try and find them all, will you?\n\nMrs Manningham checks the vase for more stones; four more emerge\n\nRough: Did you happen to read this inscription at any time, ma'am?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, I read it. Why?\n\nRough: (reading) \"Beloved A.B. from C.B. Eighteen fifty-one.\" Does nothing strike you about that?\n\nMrs Manningham: No. What of it? What should strike me?\n\nRough: Really. I should have thought that as simple as ABC. Have you got the others? There should be four more.\n\nMrs Manningham: (handing over the stones) Yes. Here they are.\n\nRough: Thank you. That's the lot. (Heputs the stones into the brooch) Now tell me this - have you ever been embraced by an elderly detective in his shirt sleeves?\n\nMrs Manningham: What do you mean?\n\nRough: For that is your immediate fate at the moment. (He puts down the brooch and moves to her) My dear Mrs Manningham - (he kisses her) my dear, dear Mrs Manningham! Don't you understand?\n\nMrs Manningham: No, what are you so excited about?\n\nRough: (leaving her, and picking up the brooch) There you are, Mrs Manningham. The Barlow Rubies - complete. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! (He hands her the brooch and the rubies) Take a good look at them before they go to the Queen.\n\nMrs Manningham: But it couldn't be - it couldn't. They were in the vase all the time.\n\nRough: Don't you see? Don't you see the whole thing? This is where the old lady hid her treasure at night - in a common trinket she wore all the day. I knew I had seen this somewhere before. And where was that? In portraits of the old lady - when I was on the case. She wore it on her breast. I remember it clearly though it was twenty years ago. Twenty years ago! Dear God in heaven, am I not a wonderful man?\n\nMrs Manningham: And I had it all the time. I had it all the time.\n\nRough: And all because he could not resist a little common theft along with the big game ... Well, it is I who am after the big game now. (He shows signs of leaving)\n\nMrs Manningham: Are you going?\n\nRough: Oh, yes. I must certainly go. (He collects his coat and things during the following) And very quickly at that.\n\nMrs Manningham: Where are you going? Are you going to leave me? What are you going to do?\n\nRough: I am going to mo ve heaven and earth, Mrs Manningham, and if I have any luck I shall be back tonight. (He looks at his watch) It's very early yet. What time do you think he'll be back?\n\nMrs Manningham: I don't know. He's not usually back till eleven. (She closes up the brooch with the rubies inside it)\n\nRough: Yes. So I thought. Let's hope so. That will give me time. Here, give me that. Have you closed it? (He takes the brooch) We will put it back where we found it. (He replaces the brooch in the bureau)\n\nMrs Manningham: But what are you going to do?\n\nRough: It's not exactly what I am going to do. It's what the Government in the person of Sir George Raglan is going to do. Yes, ma'am: Sir George Raglan. No-one less. The power above all the powers that be. He knows I am here tonight, you see. But he didn't know I was going to find what I have found ... (He pauses, looking at the broken drawer) Yes ... We've done for that, I'm afraid... Well, we must just risk it, that's all... Now Mrs Manningham, you will serve the ends of justice best by simply going to bed. Do you mind going to bed?\n\nMrs Manningham: No. I will go to bed.\n\nRough: Very well then. Go there and stay there. Your headache is worse. Be ill. Be anything. But stay there. I'll let myself out.\n\nMrs Manningham: (suddenly) Don't leave me. Please don't leave me. I have a feeling ... Don't leave me.\n\nRough: Feeling? What feeling?\n\nMrs Manningham: A feeling that something will happen if you leave me. I'm afraid. I haven't the courage.\n\nRough: Have the goodness to stop making a fool of yourself, Mrs Manningham. Here's your courage. (He gives her the bottle of whisky) Take some more of it, but don't get tipsy and don't leave it about. Goodbye. (He moves to the door)\n\nMrs Manningham: Inspector.\n\nRough: Yes.\n\nMrs Manningham: (summoning courage) All right... Goodbye.\n\nRough: Goodbye. (He goes out but turns back before completely closing the door) Mrs Manningham.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes.\n\nRough: All right... Goodbye.\n\nRough exits\n\nMrs Manningham stands staring at the door\n\nEleven o'clock that night\n\nThe room is in darkness, but the door is open and a dim light in the passage outside can be seen\n\nThere is the sound of the front door shutting. Footsteps can be heard\n\nManningham appears in the passage, humming to himself. He enters the room and goes and turns up the gas. He goes in a slow and deliberate way over to the bell-cord and pulls it. He goes over to the fire and pokes it, then sits down, the poker in his hand\n\nNancy puts her head round the door. She has only just come in and is dressed for out-of-doors, including her bonnet\n\nNancy: Yes, sir. Did you ring, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: (putting the poker down, rising) Yes, Nancy, I did ring. It seems that the entire household has gone to bed, without leaving me my milk and without leaving me my biscuits.\n\nNancy: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. They're only just outside. I'll bring them in. Mrs Manningham usually gets them, doesn't she, sir? Cook's in bed, you see, and I've only just come in.\n\nMr Manningham: Quite, Nancy. Then perhaps you will deputize for Mrs Manningham, and bring them into the room.\n\nNancy: Certainly, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: And before you do that, Nancy, will you go upstairs and tell Mrs Manningham that I wish to see her down here.\n\nNancy: Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.\n\nMr Manningham walks about, still humming to himself and taking off his overcoat. He stands by the fire\n\nNancy returns. She has a jug of milk, a glass and some biscuits on a tray; she puts them on the table\n\nMr Manningham: Well, Nancy, did you go upstairs?\n\nNancy: Yes, sir, she says she has a headache, sir, and is trying to sleep.\n\nMr Manningham: Oh - she still has a headache, has she?\n\nNancy: Yes, sir. Is there anything else you want, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Did you ever know a time when Mrs Manningham did not have a headache, Nancy?\n\nNancy: No, sir. Hardly ever, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: Do you usually perform your domestic tasks in outdoor costume, Nancy?\n\nNancy: I told you, sir. I've only just come in, and I heard the bell by chance.\n\nMr Manningham: Yes, that's just the point.\n\nNancy: How do you mean, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Will you be so good as to come closer, Nancy, where I can see you.\n\nNancy moves closer to Mr Manningham. They look at each other in a rather strange way\n\nMr Manningham: Have you any idea of the time of the day, or rather night, Nancy?\n\nNancy: Yes, sir. I thought I saw you, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: Oh - you thought you saw me. Well, I certainly saw you.\n\nNancy: Did you, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Have you ever reflected, Nancy, that you are given a great deal of latitude in this house?\n\nNancy: I don't know, sir. I don't know what latitude means.\n\nMr Manningham: Latitude, Nancy, means considerable liberty - liberty to the extent of two nights off a week.\n\nNancy: Yes, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: Well, that's all very well. It is not so well, however, when you return as late as the master of the house. We ought to keep up some pretences, you know.\n\nNancy: Yes, sir. We must. (She makes to go)\n\nMr Manningham: Nancy.\n\nNancy: Yes, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: (in a more human tone) Where the devil have you been tonight, anyway?\n\nNancy: Only with some friends, sir.\n\nMr Manningham: You know, gentleman friends have been known to take decided liberties with young ladies like yourself. Are you alive to such a possibility?\n\nNancy: Oh, no, sir. Not with me. I can look after myself.\n\nMr Manningham: Are you always so anxious to look after yourself?\n\nNancy: No, sir, not always, perhaps.\n\nMr Manningham: You know, Nancy, pretty as your bonnet is, it is not anything near so pretty as your hair beneath it. Won't you take it off and let me see it?\n\nNancy: Very good, sir. It comes off easy enough. (She takes her bonnet off) There ... Is there anything more you want, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Yes. Possibly. Come here, will you, Nancy?\n\nNancy: Yes, sir ... (She moves to him) Is there anything you want, sir ...?\n\nHe puts his arms on her shoulders\n\n(Her tone changing) What do you want? Eh? What do you want?\n\nMr Manningham kisses Nancy in a violent and prolonged manner. There is a pause in which Nancy looks at Mr Manningham, then she kisses him as violently\n\nNancy: There! Can she do that for you? Can she do that?\n\nMr Manningham: Who can you be talking about, Nancy?\n\nNancy: You know who I mean all right.\n\nMr Manningham: You know, Nancy, you are a very remarkable girl in many respects. I believe you are jealous of your mistress.\n\nNancy: She? She's a poor thing. There's no need to be jealous of her. You want to kiss me again, don't you. Don't you want to kiss me?\n\nMr Manningham kisses Nancy\n\nNancy: There! That's better than a sick headache - ain't it? - a sick headache and a pale face all the day.\n\nMr Manningham: Why yes, Nancy, I believe it is. I think, however, don't you, that it would be better if you and I met one evening in different surroundings.\n\nNancy: Yes. Where? I'll meet you when you like. You're mine now - ain't you? - 'cos you want me. You want me - don't you?\n\nMr Manningham: And what of you, Nancy? Do you want me?\n\nNancy: Oh, yes! I always wanted you, ever since I first clapped eyes on you. I wanted you more than all of them.\n\nMr Manningham: Oh - there are plenty of others?\n\nNancy: Oh, yes - there's plenty of others.\n\nMr Manningham: So I rather imagined. And only nineteen.\n\nNancy: Where can we meet? Where do you want us to meet?\n\nMr Manningham: Really, Nancy, you have taken me a little by surprise. I'll let you know tomorrow.\n\nNancy: How'll you let me know, when she's about?\n\nMr Manningham: Oh, I'll find a way.\n\nNancy: Not that I care for her. I'd like to kiss you under her very nose. That's what I'd like to do.\n\nMr Manningham: All right, Nancy. Now you had better go. I have some work to do.\n\nNancy: Go? I don't want to go.\n\nMr Manningham: There, run along. I have some work to do.\n\nNancy: Work? What are you going to work at? What are you going to do?\n\nMr Manningham: Oh - I'm going to write some letters. Go along, Nancy, that's a good girl.\n\nNancy: Oh, very well, sir. You shall be master for a little more. (She kisses him) Good-night, your lordship.\n\nMr Manningham: Good-night.\n\nNancy: (moving to the door) When shall you let me know tomorrow?\n\nMr Manningham: (going to the bureau and pulling out his keys) When I find time, Nancy, when I find time. Good-night.\n\nNancy: Good-night!\n\nNancy exits\n\nMr Manningham opens the bureau and sits down. He rises and gets some papers from his overcoat pocket and sits down again. He takes up the pen and begins to write. He rises, and stands at the side of the bureau looking for another key on the chain. He finds it and applies it to the lock. He stops and he discovers that the lock has been forced. He examines it closely. He opens the bureau and rummages amongst the papers in it. He pulls the whole drawer out, puts it on the table and rummages amongst the papers in it. He goes to the door and hesitates. Then he goes to the bell-cord and pulls it. He puts the drawer back in the desk. He hums again\n\nNancy enters\n\nNancy: Yes. What is it now?\n\nMr Manningham: Nancy, will you please go upstairs and take a message for me to Mrs Manningham.\n\nNancy: Yes. What do you want me to say?\n\nMr Manningham: Will you please tell her that she is to come down here this instant, whether she is suffering from a sick headache or any other form of ailment.\n\nNancy: Just like that, sir?\n\nMr Manningham: Just like that, Nancy.\n\nNancy: With the greatest of pleasure, sir.\n\nNancy exits\n\nMr Manningham looks at the drawer again carefully, and begins humming again. He walks over to the fireplace and stands with his back to it, waiting\n\nNancy enters\n\nNancy: She won't come. She doesn't mean to come.\n\nMr Manningham: (stepping forward) What do you mean, Nancy - she won't come?\n\nNancy: She said she can't come - she's not well enough. She's just shamming, if you ask me.\n\nMr Manningham: Really? Then she forces me to be undignified. (He walks over to the door) All right, Nancy, leave it to me.\n\nNancy: The door's locked. She's got it locked. I tried it.\n\nMr Manningham: Oh - really - the door is locked, is it? Very well... (He heads past her)\n\nNancy: She won't let you in. I can tell by her voice. She's got it locked and she won't open it. Are you going to batter it in?\n\nMr Manningham: No - perhaps you are right, Nancy ... Let us try more delicate means of attaining our ends... (He goes to the bureau and writes a note during the following) Perhaps you will take a note to this wretched imbecile and slip it under her door.\n\nNancy: Yes. I'll do that. What are you going to write?\n\nMr Manningham: Never mind what I am going to write. I'll tell you what you can do though, Nancy.\n\nNancy: Yes? What?\n\nMr Manningham: Just go down to the basement and bring the little dog here, will you?\n\nNancy: The dog?\n\nMr Manningham: The dog, yes.\n\nNancy: What's the game? What's the idea with the dog?\n\nMr Manningham: Never mind. Just go and get it, will you?\n\nNancy: All right. (She moves to the door)\n\nMr Manningham: Or on second thoughts perhaps you need not get the dog. We will just let it be supposed that we have the dog. That will be even more delicate still. (He holds out the note to Nancy) Here you are, Nancy. Please go and put this under the door.\n\nNancy: (after a pause; taking the letter) What's the idea? What have you written in this?\n\nMr Manningham: Nothing very much. Just a little smoke for getting rats out of holes. There. Run along.\n\nNancy: You're arum beggar, ain't you? (She moves to the door) Can't I look?\n\nMr Manningham: Go on, Nancy.\n\nNancy exits\n\nLeft alone, Mr Manningham shuts and locks the top of his bureau. Then he carefully places an armchair facing the fireplace - as though he is staging some ceremony. He looks around the room. Then he takes up his place infront of the fire, and waits\n\nNancy enters\n\nNancy: She's coming. It's done the trick all right.\n\nMr Manningham: Ah - so I thought. Very well, Nancy. Now I shall be obliged if you will go to bed at once.\n\nNancy: Go on. What's the game? What's the row about?\n\nMr Manningham: Nancy, will you please go to bed.\n\nNancy: (comingforward to him) All right, I'm going. (She kisses him) Good night, old dear. Give her what-for, won't you?\n\nMr Manningham: Good-night, Nancy.\n\nNancy: Ta-ta. (She heads for the door)\n\nMrs Manningham appears and stands in the doorway\n\nNancy: Perhaps you will let me pass, madam.\n\nMrs Manningham says nothing but steps aside\n\nNancy exits, closing the door\n\nThere is a long pause. Mr Manningham goes past his wife to the door, opens it, and looks to see that Nancy is not there. He comes back, stands again with his back to the fireplace and looks at Mrs Manningham\n\nMr Manningham: (indicating the chair he placed by the fireplace) Come and sit down in this chair, please, Bella.\n\nMrs Manningham: (not moving) Where is the dog? Where have you got the dog?\n\nMr Manningham: Dog? What dog?\n\nMrs Manningham: You said you had the dog. Have you hurt it? Let me have it. Where is it? Have you hurt it again?\n\nMr Manningham: Again? This is strange talk, Bella - from you - after what you did to the dog a few weeks ago. Come and sit down there.\n\nMrs Manningham: I do not want to speak to you. I am not well. I thought you had the dog and were going to hurt it. That is why I came down.\n\nMr Manningham: The dog, my dear Bella, was merely a ruse to compel you to pay me a visit quietly. Come and sit down where I told you.\n\nMrs Manningham: No. I want to go.\n\nMr Manningham: (shouting) Come and sit down where I told you!\n\nMrs Manningham: (moving DS) Yes ... Yes ... What do you want?\n\nMr Manningham: Quite a good deal Bella. Sit down and make yourself comfortable. We have plenty of time.\n\nMrs Manningham sits, and suddenly rises again\n\nMrs Manningham: I want to go. You cannot keep me here. I want to go.\n\nMr Manningham: (calmly) Sit down and make yourself comfortable, Bella. We have plenty of time.\n\nMrs Manningham: (going to a chair other than the one indicated and which is nearer the door) Say what you have to say.\n\nMr Manningham: Now you are not sitting in the chair I indicated, Bella.\n\nMrs Manningham: What have you to say?\n\nMr Manningham: I have to say that you are not sitting in the chair I indicated. Are you afraid of me that you desire to get so near the door?\n\nMrs Manningham: No, I am not afraid of you.\n\nMr Manningham: Indeed. Then you have a good deal of courage, my dear. However, will you now sit down where I told you?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. (She slowly returns to the chair by the fire)\n\nMr Manningham: Do you know what you remind me of, Bella, as you walk across the room?\n\nMrs Manningham: No. What do I remind you of?\n\nMr Manningham: A somnambulist, Bella. Have you ever seen such a person?\n\nMrs Manningham: No, I have never seen one.\n\nMr Manningham: Haven't you? Not that funny, glazed, dazed look of the wandering mind - the body that acts without the soul to guide it? I have often thought you had that look, but it's never been so strong as tonight.\n\nMrs Manningham: My mind is not wandering.\n\nMr Manningham: No? When I came in, Bella, I was told that you had gone to bed.\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. I had gone to bed.\n\nMr Manningham: Then may I ask why you are still fully dressed?\n\nMrs Manningham does not answer\n\nMr Manningham: Did you hear what I said?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, I heard what you said.\n\nMr Manningham: Then will you tell me why, since you had gone to bed. you are still fully dressed?\n\nMrs Manningham: I don't know.\n\nMr Manningham: You don't know? Do you know anything about anything you do?\n\nMrs Manningham: I don't know. I forgot to undress.\n\nMr Manningham: You forgot to undress. A curious oversight, if I may say so, Bella. You know, you give me the appearance of having had a rather exciting time since I last saw you. Almost as though you have been up to something. Have you been up to something?\n\nMrs Manningham: No. I don't know what you mean.\n\nMr Manningham: Did you find that bill I told you to find?\n\nMrs Manningham: No.\n\nMr Manningham: (moving to the table and picking up the milk jug) Do you remember what I said would happen to you if you did not find that bill when I returned tonight?\n\nMrs Manningham: No.\n\nMr Manningham: No? (He pours milk into a glass) No?\n\nShe refuses to answer\n\nMr Manningham: Am I married to a dumb woman, Bella, in addition to all else? The array of your physical and mental deficiencies is growing almost overwhelming. I advise you to answer me.\n\nMrs Manningham: What do you want me to say?\n\nMr Manningham: I asked you if you remembered something. (He moves back to the fireplace with a glass of milk) Go on, Bella - what was it I asked you if you remembered?\n\nMrs Manningham: I don't understand your words. You talk round and round. My head is going round and round.\n\nMr Manningham: It is not necessary for you to tell me that, Bella. I am just wondering if it might interrupt its gyratory motion for a fraction of a second, and concentrate upon the present conversation. Now please, what was it I a moment ago asked you if you remembered?\n\nMrs Manningham: (laboured) You asked me if I remembered what you said would happen to me if I did not find that bill.\n\nMr Manningham: Admirable, my dear Bella! Admirable! We shall make a great logician of you yet - a Socrates - a John Stuart Mill! You shall go down to history as the shining mind of your day. That is, if your present history does not altogether submerge you - take you away from your fellow creatures. And there is a danger of that, you know, in more ways than one. Well - what did I say I would do if you did not find that bill?\n\nMrs Manningham: You said you would lock me up.\n\nMr Manningham: Yes. And do you believe me to be a man of my word?\n\nThere is a pause in which Mrs Manningham does not answer\n\nMr Manningham: You see, Bella, in a life of considerable and varied experience I have hammered out a few principles of action. In fact I actually fancy I know how to deal with my fellow men. I learned it quite early, actually - at school, in fact. There, you know, there were two ways of getting at what you wanted. One was along an intellectual plane, the other along the physical. If one failed one used the other. I took that lesson into life with me. Hitherto, with you, I have worked, with what forbearance and patience I leave you to judge, along the intellectual plane. The time has come now, I believe, to work along the other as well ... You will understand that I am a man of some power ...\n\nMrs Manningham suddenly looks at him\n\nMr Manningham: Why do you look at me, Bella? I said I am a man of some power and determination, and as fully capable in one direction as in the other... I will leave your imagination to work on what I mean... However, we are really digressing ... You did not find the bill I told you to find.\n\nMrs Manningham: No.\n\nMr Manningham: Did you look for it? (He moves towards the bureau)\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes.\n\nMr Manningham: Where did you look for it?\n\nMrs Manningham: Oh, around the room ...\n\nMr Manningham: Around the room. Where around the room? (Pause) In my desk, for instance?\n\nMrs Manningham: No - not in your desk.\n\nMr Manningham: Why not in my desk?\n\nMrs Manningham: Your desk is locked.\n\nMr Manningham: Do you imagine you can lie to me?\n\nMrs Manningham: I am not lying.\n\nMr Manningham: Come here, Bella.\n\nMrs Manningham: (moving to him) What do you want?\n\nMr Manningham: Now, listen to me. Your dark, confused, rambling mind has led you into playing some pretty tricks tonight - has it not?\n\nMrs Manningham: My mind is tired. I want to go to bed.\n\nMr Manningham: Your mind is indeed tired. Your mind is so tired that it cannolongerworkatall. You do notthink. You dream. Dream all day long. Dream everything. Dream maliciously and incessantly. Don't you know that by now? You sleep-walking imbecile, what have you been dreaming tonight - where has your mind wandered - that you have split open my desk? What strange diseased dream have you had tonight - eh?\n\nMrs Manningham: Dream? Are you saying I have dreamed ... Dreamed all that happened?\n\nMr Manningham: All that happened when, Bella? Tonight? Of course you dreamed all that happened - or rather all that didn't happen.\n\nMrs Manningham: Dream... Tonight... Are you saying I have dreamed? ... (Pause) Oh, God - have I dreamed? Have I dreamed again ... ?\n\nMr Manningham: Have I not told you ?\n\nDuring the following, Mr Manningham forces Mrs Manningham into the small chair\n\nMrs Manningham: (storming) I haven't dreamed. I haven't! Don't tell me that I have dreamed. In the name of God don't tell me that!\n\nMr Manningham: (simultaneously) Sit down and be quiet. Sit down!\n\nMr Manningham: (more quietly and inquisitively) What was this dream of yours, Bella? You interest me.\n\nMrs Manningham: I dreamt of a man - (Hysterically) I dreamt of a man - -\n\nMr Manningham: (now very inquisitively) You dreamed of a man, Bella? What man did you dream of, pray?\n\nMrs Manningham: A man. A man that came to see me. Let me rest! Let me rest!\n\nMr Manningham: Pull yourself together, Bella. What man are you talking about?\n\nMrs Manningham: I dreamed a man came in here.\n\nMr Manningham: I know you dreamed it, you gibbering wretch! I want to know more about this man of whom you dreamed. Do you hear! Do you hear me!\n\nMrs Manningham: I dreamed ... I dreamed ...\n\nRough enters through the door R from the inner room\n\nRough: Was I any part of this curious dream of yours, Mrs Manningham? Perhaps my presence here will help you to recall it.\n\nMr Manningham: (after a pause) May I ask who the devil you are, and how you got in?\n\nRough: Well, who I am seems a little doubtful. Apparently I am a mere figment of Mrs Manningham's imagination. As for how I got in: I came in, or rather I came back - or better still, I effected an entrance a few minutes before you, and I have been hidden away ever since.\n\nMr Manningham: And would you be kind enough to tell me what you are doing here?\n\nRough: Waiting for some friends, Mr Manningham. waiting for some friends. Don't you think you had better go up to bed, Mrs Manningham? You look very tired.\n\nMr Manningham: Don't you think you had better explain your business, sir?\n\nRough: Well, as a mere figment, as a mere ghost existing only in your wife's mind, I can hardly be said to have any business. Tell me, Mr Manningham, can you see me? No doubt your wife can, but it must be difficult for you. Perhaps if she goes to her room I will vanish, and you won't be bothered by me any more.\n\nMr Manningham: Bella. Go to your room.\n\nMrs Manningham stares at both Rough and her husband in turn in apprehension and wonderment. She goes to the door\n\nMr Manningham: I shall find out the meaning of this, and deal with you in due course.\n\nMrs Manningham: I - -\n\nMr Manningham: Go to your room. I will call you down later. I have not finished with you yet, madam.\n\nMrs Manningham looks at both of them again, and exits\n\nRough: Youknow, I believe you're wrong there, Manningham. I believe that is just what you have done.\n\nMr Manningham: Done what?\n\nRough: Finished with your wife, my friend. (He sits down easily in an armchair)\n\nMrs Manningham: Now, sir - will you have the goodness to tell me your name, and your business, if any?\n\nRough: I have no name, Manningham, in my present capacity. I am, as I have pointed out, a mere spirit. Perhaps a spirit of something you have evaded all your life - but in any case, only a spirit. Will you have a cigar with a spirit? We may have to wait some time.\n\nMr Manningham: Are you going to explain your business, sir, or am I going to fetch a policeman and have you turned out?\n\nRough: (lighting a cigar) Ah - an admirable idea. I could have thought of nothing better myself. Yes, fetch a policeman, Manningham, and have me turned out... (Pause) Why do you wait?\n\nMr Manningham: Alternatively, sir, I can turn you out myself.\n\nRough: (standing and facing Mr Manningham) Yes. But why not fetch a policeman?\n\nMr Manningham: (after a pause) You give me the impression, sir, that you have something up your sleeve. Will you go on with what you were saying?\n\nThe gaslights slowly fade during the following\n\nRough: Yes, certainly. Where was I? Yes. (He pauses) Excuse me, Mr Manningham, but do you get the same impression as myself?\n\nMr Manningham: What impression?\n\nRough: An impression that the light is going down in this room.\n\nMr Manningham: I have noticed it.\n\nRough: Yes... surely ... There ...\n\nThe Lights fade slowly down almost to darkness\n\nRough: Eerie, isn't it? Now we are almost in the dark... Why do you think that has happened? You don't suppose a light has been put on somewhere else ... You don't suppose that strangers have entered the house? You don't supposethereare other spirits - fellow spirits of mine - spirits surrounding this house now - spirits of justice, even, which have caught up with you at last, Mr Manningham?\n\nMr Manningham: Are you off your head, sir?\n\nRough: No, sir. Just an old man seeing ghosts. It must be the atmosphere of this house. (Walking about) I can see them everywhere. It's the oddest thing. Do you know one ghost I can see, Mr Manningham? You could hardly believe it.\n\nMr Manningham: What ghost do you see, pray?\n\nRough: Why, it's the ghost of an old woman, sir - the ghost of an old woman twenty years ago - an old woman who once lived in this house, who once lived in this very room. Yes - in this very room. What things I imagine!\n\nMr Manningham: What are you saying?\n\nRough: Remarkably clear, sir, I see it... An old woman getting ready to go to bed - here in this very room - an old woman getting ready to go up to bed at the end of the day. Why! There she is. She sits just there. And now it seems I see another ghost as well.\n\nPause\n\nRough: (Looking at Mr Manningham) I see the ghost of a young man, Mr Manningham - a handsome, tall, well-groomed young man. But this young man has murder in his eyes. Why, God bless my soul, he might be you, Mr Manningham - he might be you! The old woman sees him. Don' t you see it all? She screams - screams for help - screams before her throat is cut - cut open with a knife. She lies dead on the floor - the floor of this room of this house. There! (Pause) Now I don't see that ghost any more.\n\nMr Manningham: What's the game - eh? What's the game?\n\nRough: (confronting Manningham) But I still see the ghost of the man. I see him, all through the night, as he ransacks the house, hour after hour, room after room, ripping everything up. turning everything out, madly seeking the thing he cannot find. Then twenty years pass, and where is he? Why, sir, is he not still in the same house, the house he ransacked, the house he searched - and does he not now stand before the ghost of the woman he killed, in the room in which he killed her? A methodical man, apatient man, but perhaps he has waited too long. For justice has waited too, and here she is, in my person, to exact her due. And justice found, my friend, in one hour what you sought for twenty years, and still could not find. See here. Look what she found. (He moves to the bureau and picks up the bill, the letter and the brooch as he mentions them) First a bill which your wife had lost. Then a letter which never reached your wife. Then a brooch which you gave your wife but which she lost. How wicked of her! But then she didn't know its value. How was she to know that it held the Barlow Rubies. There (He opens out the brooch) See. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! There you are, sir! You killed one woman for those and tried to drive another out of her mind. And all the time they lay in your own desk, and all they have brought you is a rope around your neck! Well, the game is over, Sydney Power, and I advise you to take the matter philosophically.\n\nMr Manningham: You seem, sir, to have some very remarkable information. Do you imagine you are going to leave this room with such information in your possession? (He moves to the door as though to lock it)\n\nRough: Do you imagine, sir, that you are going to leave this room without suitable escort?\n\nMr Manningham: May I ask what you mean by that?\n\nRough: Only that I have men in the house already. Didn't you realize that they had signalled their arrival from above, your own way in, Mr Manningham, when the light went down?\n\nThere is a pause in which Mr Manningham looks at Rough\n\nMr Manningham: Here you... What the devil's this? (He rushes to the door and opens it)\n\nTwo men are standing outside the door, blocking his exit\n\nMr Manningham: Ah, gentlemen - come in. Come in. Make yourselves at home. Here. (He makes a plunge to escape) '\n\nA struggle ensues. During the following, the two men force Mr Manningham into a chair. Rough, seeing help is needed, goes to the window, produces a knife and cuts the cord of the Venetian blind which comes rattling down. They secure Mr Manningham with the cord\n\nMr Manningham: Leave go of me, will you? Here. Leave go of me! Here's a fine way of going on. Here's a fine way!\n\nOne of the men gives Rough a paper\n\nRough: (going up to Mr Manningham) Sydney Charles Power, I have a warrant for your arrest for the murder of Alice Barlow. I should warn you that anything you may say now may be taken down in writing and used as evidence at a later date. Will you accompany us to the station in a peaceful manner? You will oblige us all, and serve your own interests best, Power, by coming with us quietly ...\n\nMr Manningham renews his struggle\n\nRough: Very well - take him away ...\n\nThe men prepare to take Mr Manningham away\n\nMrs Manningham enters\n\nThere is a silence\n\nMrs Manningham: Inspector Rough ...\n\nRough: (moving to her) Yes, my dear, now don't you think you'd better ...\n\nMrs Manningham: (in a weak voice) Inspector ...\n\nRough: Yes?\n\nMrs Manningham: I want to speak to my husband.\n\nRough: Now, surely, there's nothing to be - -\n\nMrs Manningham: I want to speak to my husband.\n\nRough: Very well, my dear, what do you want to say?\n\nMrs Manningham: I want to speak to him alone.\n\nRough: Alone?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, alone. Won't you please let me speak to him alone. I beg of you to allow me. I will not keep him long.\n\nRough: (after a pause) I don't quite understand. Alone? (Pause) Very well. You may speak to him alone. (To the men) Very well. (He signals to the men that they are to tie Mr Manningham to the chair)\n\nThe men tie Mr Manningham as instructed\n\nRough: This is anything but in order - but we will wait outside. I'm afraid you must not be long, Mrs Manningham.\n\nMrs Manningham: I do not want you to listen.\n\nRough: No, I will not listen.\n\nRough hesitates, then he and the men exit\n\nMrs Manningham stands looking at her husband. At last she goes over to the UL door and locks it, then moves to him\n\nMrs Manningham: Jack! Jack! What have they done to you? What have they done?\n\nMr Manningham: (struggling at his bonds, half-whispering) Take it easy, Bella. You're clever. Get something to cut this and I'll get away. I can get out through the dressing-room, and make a jump for it. Can you get something?\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes, I can get something. What can I get?\n\nMr Manningham: There's a razor in my dressing-room. In there! Quick! Be quick! Go and get it!\n\nMrs Manningham: Yes. I will get it! I will get it for you.\n\nMr Manningham: There's a good girl. You're a good girl. Quick! Be quick!\n\nMrs Manningham goes over to the door UR, and appears to try it. Her expression completely changes\n\nMrs Manningham: How strange! The door is locked!\n\nMr Manningham: What do you mean - locked? There's the key, there! I see it. Tum the key, and go in!\n\nMrs Manningham suddenly and savagely locks the door, and takes out the key\n\nMrs Manningham: Key? What key? You are not suggesting that this is a key I hold in my hand? Have you gone mad, my husband? (She hurls the key across the room)\n\nMr Manningham: What's the game, Bella?\n\nMrs Manningham: (moving to him) Or is it I who am mad? Yes. That is it. Of course. I am mad. It was a key, and I have lost it. Dear God - I have lost it, haven't I? I am always losing things. And I can never find them. I don't know where I put them.\n\nMr Manningham: Bella ...\n\nMrs Manningham: I must look for it, mustn't I? Yes... If I don't find it you will lock me in my room - you will lock me in the mad-house for my mischief. Where could it be now? Could it be behind the picture? Yes, it must be there. (She goes to the picture and takes it down) No - it is not there - how strange. I must put the picture back, mustn't I? I have taken it down, and I must put it back. There. (She puts the picture back) Where now shall I look? The desk. Perhaps I put it in the desk. (She goes to the desk) No, it is not here. (She picks up the bill, the letter and the watch as she mentions them) Here is a bill. Here is a letter. Here is a watch. See. (She moves to him, the items in her hand) Take them. I have found them at last, you see! But they don't help you, do they? And I am trying to help you, aren't I? To help you to escape ... But how can a mad woman help her husband to escape? What a pity ... (Getting louder and louder) If I were not mad I could have helped you - if I were not mad, whatever you had done, I could have pitied and protected you! But because I am mad I have hated you, and because I am mad I have betrayed you, and because I am mad I am rejoicing with my heart - without a shred of pity - without a shred of regret - watching you go with glory in my heart! (She pauses, looking at him. She breathes deeply. She suddenly goes to the door UL and flings it open) Inspector! Inspector! Come and take this man away! Come and take this man away!\n\nRough and the others come in\n\nMrs Manningham: (Moving to Rough, completely hysterical) Come and take this man away!\n\n(She buries her head on Rough's shoulder)\n\nRough: Very well - take him along. I'll join you a little later.\n\nThe men take Manningham off in silence\n\nRough: Now, my dear, come and sit down. Well, my child, there's all your life ahead now. It's Devonshire cream for you, and the sparkle back in your eyes. But you've had a bad time. I came in from nowhere and gave you the most horrible evening of your life, didn't I? The most horrible evening of anybody's life, I should imagine.\n\nMrs Manningham: The most horrible ... Oh, no ... (With a sort of proud defiance) The most wonderful... Far and away the most wonderful.",

He changed his name, and he has waited all these years, until he found it safe to acquire this house in a legal way. He then acquired the empty house next door. Every night, for the last few weeks, he has entered that house from the back, climbed up on to its roof and come into this house by the skylight. I know that because I have seen him do it. You have watched the gaslight, and been aware of the same thing. He is up there now. Why he should employ this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting at what he wants, God himself only knows.

  "raw_expressions_labeling_response": "[Mr Manningham]: What are you doing, Bella? -- {Dismissal, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Nothing, dear... (She moves back to the window to look out) Don't wake yourself. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Mr Manningham]: (closing his eyes again) What are you doing, Bella? Come here ... -- {Dismissal, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Mr Manningham]: This fire's in ashes. Ring the bell, will you, Bella dear, please? -- {Demanding}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... (She moves towards the bell, but stops) Is it merely to put coal on, my dear? I can do that. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now then, Bella. We've had this out before. Be so good as to ring the bell. -- {Dismissal, Demanding}\n[Mr Manningham]: (stopping her with an outstretched hand) No, no, no, no, no ... Where's the girl? Let the girl come up if Lizzie's out. -- {Demanding}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go and ring the bell, please, Bella - there's a good child. -- {Demanding, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: What do you suppose the servants are for, Bella? -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go on. Answer me. What do you suppose servants are for? -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have no doubt of it, my dear. It's sheer weak mindedness to think otherwise. -- {Belittiling, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: You're looking very impudent and pretty this afternoon, Nancy. Do you know that? -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Or are women too jealous of their discoveries to pass them on to a rival? -- {Provocation, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause, reproachfully rather than angrily) Oh, Jack, how can you treat me like that? -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: But, my dear, you're the mistress of the house. It was your business to tell her to put the coal on. -- {Blaming, Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Mr Manningham]: But you seem to look upon the servants as our natural equals. So I treated her as one. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Laughs at you? What an idea. What makes you think she laughs at you? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: But, my dear- if she does that, doesn't the fault lie with you? -- {Blaming, Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't mean anything. It's you who read meanings into everything, Bella dear. I wish you weren't such a perfect little silly. -- {Belittiling, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I read that Mr MacNaughton - the celebrated actor - is in London for another season. -- {Changing the topic}\n[Mr Manningham]: I not only would take you to see MacNaughton, my dear. I am going to take you to see MacNaughton. That is, if you want to go. -- {Manipulation, Strategic facts sharing}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, my dear, you've been very good lately, and I thought it would be well to take you out of yourself. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, Jack dear. You have been so much kinder lately. Is it possible you're beginning to see my point of view? -- {Indirectly accusing of previous unkind behavior}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't know that I ever differed from it, did I, Bella? -- {Denying, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: How do you mean, my dear, exactly, better? -- {Being oppositional, Not attempting to understand}\n[Mr Manningham]: I wonder if it is that - or whether it's merely that your medicine is beginning to benefit you? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well - we are talking about gloomy subjects, aren't we? -- {Changing the topic, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, dear. Don't I seem to? Haven't I just said I'm taking you to the theatre? -- {Ignoring her emotional needs, Being abrupt}\n[Mr Manningham]: I think you imagine things, my dear. -- {Gaslighting, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: (suddenly rising, looking at the wall opposite him; in a calm, yet menacing voice) I don't know, I'm sure ... I don't know ... -- {Abrupt reaction, Sending mixed signals}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know perfectly well what has happened, Bella, and if you will rectify it at once I will say no more about it. -- {Accusing, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you trying to make a fool of me, Bella? What I refer to is on the wall behind you. If you will put it back, I will forget the matter. -- {Accusation, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Why has it been taken down? Why, indeed? You alone can answer that, Bella. Why was it taken down before? Will you please take it from wherever you have hidden it, and put it back on the wall again. -- {Accusation, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: Someone else? Are you suggesting that I should play such a fantastic and wicked trick? -- {Gaslighting, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Someone else, eh? Someone else. (Shaking her off ) Will you leave go of me. You repel me - you half-witted thing. (He walks over to the bell-cord) We will see about \"someone else\". -- {Dismissal, Insulting, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (shaking her off violently) Will you leave go of me and sit down there! (He moves to the fireplace) Someone else - eh? Well - we shall see. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mr Manningham]: You had better pull yourself together, hadn't you ... ? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah, Elizabeth, do you notice anything amiss in this room? Look carefully around the walls, and see if you notice anything amiss ... Well, Elizabeth, what do you notice? -- {Manipulation, Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Exactly. The picture has been taken down. You noticed it at once. Now was that picture in its place when you dusted the room this morning? -- {Diminishing, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: Neither do I, Elizabeth, neither do I. And now, before you go, just one question. Was it you who removed that picture, Elizabeth? -- {Gaslighting, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed, why should you? And now please, will you kiss that Bible, which lies on that desk there, as a token of your truthfulness... -- {Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Very well, you may go. And please send Nancy in here at once. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving to Mr Manningham) Jack - spare me that girl. Don't call her in. I'll say anything. I'll say that I did it. I did it, Jack, I did it. Don't have that girl in. Don't! -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you have the goodness to contain yourself? -- {Diminishing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: I did not ask for any comment on your part, Nancy. Kindly be less insolent and answer what I ask you. Did you take that picture down, or did you not? -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then, by God, you are mad, and you don't know what you do. You unhappy wretch - you're stark gibbering mad - like your wretched mother before you. -- {Gaslighting, Accusation, Cruel humor, Poking at others weaknesses}\n[Mr Manningham]: (after a pause) The time has come to face facts, Bella. If this progresses you will not be much longer under my protection. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack - I'm going to make a last appeal to you. I'm going to make a last appeal. I'm desperate, Jack. Can' t you see that I'm desperate? If you can't, you must have a heart of stone. -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella, my dear - have you any idea where that picture is now? -- {Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then you did know where it was, Bella. You did know where it was. -- {Gaslighting, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: There is no sense in walking about the room with a picture in your hand, Bella. Go and put it back in its proper place. -- {Diminishing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, Bella, I said a moment ago that we have got to face facts. And that is what we have got to do. I am not going to say anything at the moment for my feelings are running too high. In fact, I am going out immediately, and I suggest that you go to your room and lie down for a little in the dark. -- {Dismissal, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: There is no question of sending you to your room, Bella. You know perfectly well that you may do exactly as you please. Everything - - -- {Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, no argument, please. I had to go in any case after tea, and I am merely leaving a little earlier, that's all. (He puts on his hat and coat. Pause) Now, is there anything I can get for you? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring relation repair attempts}\n[Mr Manningham]: (coming to her and shaking her violently) Will you control yourself! Will you control yourself! Listen to me, madam, if you utter another sound I'll knock you down and take you to your room and lock you in darkness for a week. I have been too lenient with you, and I mean to alter my tactics. -- {Threats, Power games, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: May God help you, indeed. Now listen to me. I am going to leave you until ten o'clock. In that time you will recover that paper, and admit to me that you have lyingly and purposely concealed it... If not, you will take the consequences. You are going to see a doctor, madam, more than one doctor - and they shall decide what this means. Now do you understand me? -- {Threats, Blaming, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: (moving to the door) I have been patient with you and controlled myself long enough. It is no w for you to control yourself, or take the consequences. Think upon that, Bella. -- {Blaming, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: What a question to ask me at such a time. No, madam, emphatically I am not. You play fair by me, and I'll play fair by you. If we are going to be enemies, you and I, you will find that it is I who shall get the best of it. -- {Power games, Threats}\n\n\n[Elizabeth]: Madam, there's somebody called. -- {Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: It's a gentleman, madam - he wants to see you. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Tell him to go. Elizabeth. He wants to see my husband. My husband's out. -- {Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: No, madam - he wants to see you. You must see him, madam. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, leave me alone. Tell him to go away. I want to be left alone. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Madam, madam. I don't know what's going on between you and the master, but you've got to hold up, madam. You've got to hold up. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I am going out of my mind, Elizabeth. That's what's going on. -- {Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: Don't talk like that, madam. You've got to be brave. You mustn't go on lying here in the dark, or your mind will go. You must see this gentleman. It's you he wants - not the master. He's waiting below. Come, madam, it'll take you out of yourself. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: You're a good deal younger and more attractive than I thought, you know. But you're looking very pale. Have you been crying? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: You will do so, madam, very shortly. (He moves L and removes his scarf during the following) You're the lady who's going off her head, aren't you? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: I very much doubt whether God knows anything of the sort, Mrs Manningham. Had he done so I believe he would have come to your aid before this. But I am here, and so you must give me your faith. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Before I go any further, Mrs Manningham, I must tell you there's a leakage in this household. You have a maid called Nancy? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I knew it! I knew she talked. Now I know it, she shall be dismissed. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Oh, no - no such retribution is going to overtake her at the moment, Mrs Manningham. In fact, I fancy you are going to be heavily in debt to your maid, Nancy. If it were not for her indiscretions I should not be here now, should I? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: I'm afraid I shall have to keep you in the dark for a little, Mrs Manningham, as I am still quite far down in the dark myself. Can I have another lump of sugar in this? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: And does your husband always leave you alone like this in the evenings? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: And does your husband give you a free run of the whole house while he's out? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Now, Mrs Manningham, to ask a personal question: when did you first get the notion into your head that your reason was playing you tricks? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Never mind how I know. How did it begin? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Is it the house itself you fear, Mrs Manningham? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: And has the top floor got anything to do with it? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Ah - now you interest me beyond measure. Do tell me about the top floor. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Have you told your husband about this? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: It never struck you, did it, that it might be your own husband walking about up there? -- {Dismissal}\n\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes - that is what I thought - but I thought I must be mad. Tell me how you knew. -- {Not offering constructive solutions, Not verifying the negative assumptions about the other person}\n[Rough]: Why not tell me first how you knew, Mrs Manningham. -- {Changing the topic, Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It's true, then! I knew it. I knew it! When he leaves this house he comes back. He comes back and walks up there above - up and down - up and down. He comes back like a ghost. How does he get up there? -- {Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: That's what we're going to find out, Mrs Manningham. But there are such commonplace resources as roofs and fire escapes, you know. Now please don't look so frightened. Your husband is no ghost, believe me, and you are very far from mad. Tell me now, what made you first think it was him? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It was the light - the gaslight ... It went down and it went up ... Oh, thank God I can tell this to someone at last. I don't know who you are, but I must tell you. -- {Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: Now try to keep calm. You can tell me just as well sitting down, can't you? Won't you sit down? -- {Diminishing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Yes - yes - that's just a question of insufficient pressure, and it's the same in mine. But go on, please. -- {Diminishing, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Every night, after he goes out, I find myself waiting for something. Then all at once I look round the room and see that the light is slowly going down. At first I tried not to notice it, but after a time it began to get on my nerves. I would go all over the house to see if anyone had put on an extra light, but they never had. It's always the same time - about ten minutes after he goes out. That's what made me think that somehow he had come back and that it was he who was walking about up there. I go up to the bedroom but I daren't stay there because I hear noises overhead. I want to scream and run out of the house. I sit here for hours, terrified, waiting for him to come back, and I always know when he's coming again. Suddenly the light goes up again and ten minutes afterwards I hear his key in the lock downstairs, and he's back again. -- {Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: How very strange, indeed. You know. Mrs Manningham, you should have been a policeman. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Are you laughing at me? Do you think I imagine everything too? -- {Victim playing, Accusation}\n[Rough]: Oh no! I was merely praising the keenness of your observation. I not only think you are right in your suppositions, I think you have made a very remarkable discovery, and one which may have very far-reaching consequences. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Well, let's leave it for the moment. Tell me, that is not the only cause, is it, which has lately given you reason to doubt your sanity? Has anything else been happening? Don't be afraid to tell me. -- {Dismissal, Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: (putting his hands on hers) Do you know, Mrs Manningham, it has occurred to me that you'd be all the better for a little medicine. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: You shall sample it and see. (He rises and goes over to his coat) You see, it has been employed by humanity, for several ages, for the purpose of the instantaneous removal of dark fears and doubt. That seems to fit you. doesn't it? -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: (pouring two whiskies) You underestimate your powers, Mrs Manningham. You see, I don't want you thinking you can't trust your reason. This will give you faith in your reason like nothing else... -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Ah. \"The Cabman's Friend\". (He moves to the mantelpiece) You should ask me who was \"The Cabman's Friend\", Mrs Manningham, for she was an old lady who died many, many years ago. (He puts his whisky on the mantelpiece) -- {Changing the topic, Evasion}\n[Rough]: Yes. She was murdered. I was only a comparatively young officer at the time, but it made an extremely horrible, in fact I may say lasting, impression on me. The murderer was never discovered but the motive was obvious enough. The Barlow Rubies had been inherited by her, and it was well known that she kept them, without any proper precautions, in her bedroom on an upper floor. She lived alone except for a deaf servant in the basement. Well, for that she paid the penalty of her life. -- {Changing the topic, Evasion}\n[Rough]: No, Mrs Manningham, the man was never found. Nor has the Barlow jewellery ever come to light. -- {Evasion}\n\n[Rough]: I think he is almost certainly alive today, but I don't believe he found what he wanted. That is, if my theory is right. -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Then the jewels may still be where the old lady hid them? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Indeed, Mrs Manningham, if my theory is right, the jewels must still be where she hid them, but then, of course, it was only a theory and that formed in quite a young man, long enough ago. The official conclusion was quite otherwise. The police, naturally and quite excusably presumed that the murderer had got them, and there was no re-opening of matters in those days. Soon enough the public forgot about it. I forgot about it myself. But it would be funny, wouldn't it, Mrs Manningham, if after all these years I should turn out to be right. -- {Diminishing, Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, yes, indeed. But what has this to do with me? -- {Indifference, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Ah, that is the whole question, Mrs Manningham. What, indeed? What has the obscure murder of an old lady twenty years ago to do with an attractive, though I am afraid at present somewhat pale and wan young lady in this house, who believes she is going out of her mind, and watches the gaslight going up and down when her husband is out at night? Well, I believe there is a link, however remote, wild and strange it may be, and that is why I am here. -- {Invalidation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It's all so confusing. Won't you - - -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Do you conceive it possible, Mrs Manningham, that that man might not have given up hope of one day getting at the treasure which lay there, and have bided his time until he could somehow re-enter the house? -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. Yes. Possibly. But how - - ? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Can you conceive that he may have waited years - five years, ten years, fifteen years, twenty years even - time in which he may have done many things: gone abroad, got married even, until at last his chance came to resume the search begun on that terrible night? You don't follow where I am leading at all, do you, Mrs Manningham? -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Follow you? Yes, I think so. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: You know, Mrs Manningham, of the old theory that the criminal always returns to the scene of his crime. Ah, yes, but in this case there is something more than morbid compulsion. There is treasure there to be unearthed if only he can search again, search methodically, without fear of interruption, without causing suspicion. And how would he do that? Don't you think ... -- {Invalidation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Quiet! Be quiet! He has come back! Look! Look at the light! It is going down! Wait! -- {Evasion, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: What's the matter, Mrs Manningham? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: He is in the house, I tell you. You must go. He will know you are here. You must go. -- {Ignoring, Evasion}\n[Rough]: How dark it is. You could hardly see to read. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You must go. He is in the house. Please go. -- {Ignoring, Evasion}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) Quiet, Mrs Manningham, quiet! You have got to keep your head. Don't you see my meaning, yet? Don't you understand that this was the house? -- {Invalidation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: House? What house? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: The old woman's house, Mrs Manningham. This house, here, these rooms, these walls. Twenty years ago Alice Barlow lay dead in this room. Twenty years ago the man who murdered her ransacked this house - below and above - but could not find what he sought. What if he is still searching, Mrs Manningham? What if he is up there - still searching? Now do you see why you must keep your head? -- {Power games, Making others feel insecure, Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But my husband, my husband is up there! -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Precisely that, Mrs Manningham. Your husband. (He fetches the glass of whiskyfrom the mantelpiece) You see, I am afraid you are married to a tolerantly dangerous gentleman. Now drink this quickly, as we have a great deal to do. (He holds out the glass to her) -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: This house ... How do you know this was the house? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Why, ma'am, because I was on the case, and came here myself, that's all. -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: The idea is mad, mad. I have been married seven years. How can you imagine my husband is - what you imagine he may be? -- {Evasion, Denying}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham ... -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: (pouring himself another whisky) When the police came into this place twenty years ago, as you can understand there was a lot of routine work to be done - interviewing of relatives and friends and so forth. Most of that was left to me. -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Well? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Well, amongst all the acquaintances and relatives, nephews and nieces, et cetera, that I interviewed, there happened to be a young man by the name of Sydney Power. I suppose you have never heard that name at all, have you? -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Power? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Yes. Sydney Power. It conveys nothing to you? -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Sydney Power. No ... -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Well, he was a kind of distant cousin apparently much attached to the old lady, and even assisting her in her good works. The only thing was that I remembered his face. Well. I saw that face again about five weeks ago. It took me a whole day to discover where I had seen it before, but I remembered it at last. -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Well - what of it? What if you did remember him? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: It was not so much my remembering Mr Sydney Power, Mrs Manningham. What startled me was the lady on his arm, and the locality in which I saw him. -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh - who was the lady on his arm? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: You were the lady on his arm, Mrs Manningham, and you were walking down this street. -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What are you saying? Do you mean you think my husband - my husband is this Mr Power? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Well, not exactly, for if my theories are right - - -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What are you saying? You stand there talking riddles. You are so cold. You are as heartless and cold as he is. -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) No, Mrs Manningham, I am not cold, and I am not talking riddles. I am just trying to preserve a cold and calculating tone, because you are up against the most awful moment in your life, and your whole future depends on what you are going to do in the next hour. Nothing less. You have got to strike for your freedom, and strike now, for the moment may not come again. -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Strike - - -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: You are not going out of your mind, Mrs Manningham, you are slowly, methodically, systematically being driven out of your mind. And why? Because you are married to a criminal maniac who is afraid you are beginning to know too much - a criminal maniac who steals back to his own house at night, still searching for something he could not find twenty years ago. Those are the facts, wild and incredible as they may seem. His name is no more Manningham than mine is. He is Sydney Power and he murdered Alice Barlow in this house. He changed his name, and he has waited all these years, until he found it safe to acquire this house in a legal way. He then acquired the empty house next door. Every night, for the last few weeks, he has entered that house from the back, climbed up on to its roof and come into this house by the skylight. I know that because I have seen him do it. You have watched the gaslight, and been aware of the same thing. He is up there now. Why he should employ this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting at what he wants, God himself only knows. For the same reason, perhaps, that he employs this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting rid of you: that is by slowly driving you mad and sending you into a lunatic asylum. Thank God you are not married to him, and that I have come here to save you from the workings of his wicked mind. -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure, Accusation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Not married? Not married? He married me. -- {Denying, Evasion}\n[Rough]: I have no doubt he did, Mrs Manningham. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, he contracted the same sort of union with another lady many years before he met you. Moreover the lady is still alive, and the English law has a highly exacting taste in monogamy. You see, I have been finding things out about Mr Sydney Power. -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Are you speaking the truth? My God - are you speaking the truth? Where is his wife now? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: If my guesses are right, she is the length of the world away - on the continent of Australia to be precise, where I know for a fact he spent five years. Did you know that? -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. I did not know that. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Ah, yes. If only I could find her, everything would be easier, and that's the whole root of the matter, Mrs Manningham. So far I am only dealing in guesses and half facts. I have got to have evidence, and that is why I came to see you. You have got to give me the evidence or help me find it. -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: This is my husband. Don't you understand - this is my husband. He married me. Do you ask me to betray the man who married me? -- {Evasion, Denying}\n[Rough]: By which you mean, of course, the man who has betrayed you into thinking that you are married to him - don't you? -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But I'm married to him. You must go. I must think this out. You must go. I must cling to the man I married. Mustn't I? -- {Evasion, Denying}\n[Rough]: Indeed, cling to him by all means, but do not imagine you are the only piece of ivy. You can cling to him if you desire, as his fancy women cling to him in the low resorts of the town. That is the sort of wall you have to cling to, ma'am. -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Women? What are you suggesting? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: I'm not suggesting anything. I am only telling you what I have seen. He comes to life at night, this gentleman upstairs, in more ways than one. I have made it my business to follow him on some of his less serious excursions, and I can promise you he has a taste in unemployed actresses which he is at no pains to conceal. -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Is this the truth? Are you telling me the truth? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham - will you look me in the eyes again, and see if you think I am telling you the truth? -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Yes. I have known it. How strange that is ... I have known it all along ... -- {Denying, Evasion}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham, it is hard to take everything from you, but you are no more tied to this man. you are under no more obligation to him than those wretched women in those places. You must learn to be thankful for that. -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What do you want me to do? What do you want? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: (completely changing his tone, striding up and down in a business like way) I want his papers, Mrs Manningham - his identity. There is some clue somewhere in this house, and we have got to get at it. Where does he keep his papers? -- {Manipulation, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Papers? I know of no papers. Unless his bureau ... -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Yes. His bureau? His bureau? -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. There. (She points to the bureau) But he keeps it always locked. I have never seen it open. -- {Evasion}\n\n[Rough]: Oh - it doesn't look so formidable. -- {Dismissal, Undermining}\n[Rough]: Come now, ma'am. You're working with me, aren't you - not against me? -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Rough]: Do as I say, and ring the bell. At once, please. -- {Demanding}\n[Rough]: All in good time. He's not going to jump through the window, you know. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Elizabeth]: Yes, sir. But you see - - -- {Evasion, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Rough]: Are you anxious to help your mistress, blindly, without asking any questions? -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Rough]: You think of everything, Elizabeth, and you're a good soul. -- {Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Perfect accommodation. -- {Ignoring boundaries}\n[Rough]: Yes, quick. He's coming. Don't you understand. Go there and stay there. Take her, Elizabeth. You have a bad headache - a bad headache. -- {Manipulation, Creating artificial obligations}\n[Rough]: Will you take her, in heaven's name! -- {Impatience, Being abrupt}\n[Elizabeth]: No, ma'am. He knows best. He's bound to know best. -- {Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: Where is Mrs Manningham, Elizabeth? -- {Not verifying the negative assumptions about the other person}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh. I see. Then we must be quiet, mustn't we? Walk about like cats ... Can you walk about like a cat, Elizabeth? -- {Patronizing, Ridiculing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why haven't you cleared away the tea things? -- {Accusation, Not offering constructive solutions}\n[Mr Manningham]: I think you had better clear away the tea things, Elizabeth. -- {Demanding}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, I am having it out. I have come back to change my linen. -- {Ignoring previous conflict, Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why, do you know where my collars are kept? -- {Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: What a lot you know, Elizabeth. And do you know the sort of collar I want tonight? -- {Patronizing, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Then all I can say is you know a great deal more than I do ... No ... I think you must let me choose my own collar ... (He moves towards the door R and stops) That is, if I have your permission, Elizabeth. -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: What did you think about Mrs Manningham tonight, Elizabeth? -- {Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - just as regards her general health, Elizabeth. -- {Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. I doubt if you guess to what extent she is unwell. Or are you beginning to guess? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: I'm afraid I was compelled to drag you and Nancy into our troubles tonight. Perhaps I should not have done that. -- {Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Mr Manningham]: (smiling; somewhat appealingly) I'm at my wits' end, Elizabeth. Don't you know that? -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have tried everything. Kindness, patience, cunning - even harshness, to bring her to her senses. But nothing will stop these wild, wild hallucinations, nothing will stop these wicked pranks and tricks. -- {Invalidation, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: You don't know a quarter of it, Elizabeth. You only see what is forced upon your attention - as it was tonight. You have no conception of what goes on all the time. (He looks at his tie) No - not this one, I think ... (He undoes if) -- {Gaslighting, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: She died in the mad-house, Elizabeth, without any brain at all in the end. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, don't you, that I shall have to bring a doctor to Mrs Manningham before long, Elizabeth? I have fought against it to the last, but it can't be kept a secret much longer. -- {Manipulation, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: I mean to say, you know what goes on. You can testify to what goes on, can't you? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed, you may have to testify in the end. Do you realize that? -- {Manipulation, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: There now, how touching. I thank you, Elizabeth. You will be repaid later for what you have said, and repaid in more ways than one. You understand that, don't you? -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, I know that. Well, Elizabeth, I am going out. In fact, I' m even going to try and be a little gay. Can you understand that, or do you think it is wrong? -- {Manipulation, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mr Manningham]: I wonder... Yes... I wonder - it's a curious existence, isn't it? Well - good-night, Elizabeth. (He heads for the door) -- {Evasion, Diminishing}\n[Rough]: He was right when he said you would be repaid, Elizabeth. Though not in the way he thinks. (He takes off his overcoat. Pause) Will you go and get Mrs Manningham? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Now I'm afraid you're one ahead of me, Mrs Manningham. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Is his correspondence with your relations very much to the point at the moment, Mrs Manningham? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Ah, yes, I see. Just another little - - -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: I have no idea what you will say when he comes back, Mrs Manningham. But then I have no idea what you will do when he comes back, Mrs Manningham, if I have no evidence to remove you from his loving care for good. -- {Manipulation, Threats}\n\n[Rough]: There is only one thing we can do - go ahead. If we go back now, we are lost. I am going to force it and gamble on finding something. Are you with me? -- {Diminishing, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But don't you see... All right. Force it. Force it. But be quick. -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Rough]: (working on the lock) There's no hurry, ma'am. He's quite happy where he is... Now I don't like - (straining at the lock) violent methods - of this sort - it makes me feel like a dentist... There ... -- {Ignoring, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Is there anything in there? Is there anything there? -- {Impatience}\n[Rough]: Nothing at present, I' m afraid... Nothing at present... Wait a minute ... No ... No ... (Looking at a document) What's this? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Is there nothing? -- {Impatience}\n[Rough]: (looking more closely) One moment... No ... Not a thing. We have lost our gamble, ma'am, I'm afraid. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, dear. What are we to do? -- {Impatience}\n[Rough]: Some rapid thinking at the moment. Don't have any fear, Mrs Manningham, I've been in many a tighter corner than this. Let's get these things back to begin with, shall we? Give me the watch and the brooch. We must put them back where they were. -- {Diminishing, Power games}\n[Rough]: Secondhand, eh? I'm afraid you got everything secondhand from this gentleman, Mrs Manningham. -- {Belittiling, Making other feel like they are doing something wrong}\n[Rough]: For that is your immediate fate at the moment. (He puts down the brooch and moves to her) My dear Mrs Manningham - (he kisses her) my dear, dear Mrs Manningham! Don't you understand? -- {Diminishing, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No, what are you so excited about? -- {Not attempting to understand}\n[Rough]: Don't you see? Don't you see the whole thing? This is where the old lady hid her treasure at night - in a common trinket she wore all the day. I knew I had seen this somewhere before. And where was that? In portraits of the old lady - when I was on the case. She wore it on her breast. I remember it clearly though it was twenty years ago. Twenty years ago! Dear God in heaven, am I not a wonderful man? -- {Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: And I had it all the time. I had it all the time. -- {Exaggeration}\n[Rough]: And all because he could not resist a little common theft along with the big game ... Well, it is I who am after the big game now. (He shows signs of leaving) -- {Diminishing, Power games}\n[Rough]: I am going to mo ve heaven and earth, Mrs Manningham, and if I have any luck I shall be back tonight. (He looks at his watch) It's very early yet. What time do you think he'll be back? -- {Diminishing, Power games}\n[Rough]: Have the goodness to stop making a fool of yourself, Mrs Manningham. Here's your courage. (He gives her the bottle of whisky) Take some more of it, but don't get tipsy and don't leave it about. Goodbye. (He moves to the door) -- {Diminishing, Disrespect, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, Nancy, I did ring. It seems that the entire household has gone to bed, without leaving me my milk and without leaving me my biscuits. -- {Complaining, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Quite, Nancy. Then perhaps you will deputize for Mrs Manningham, and bring them into the room. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you ever know a time when Mrs Manningham did not have a headache, Nancy? -- {Dismissal, Belittiling}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you usually perform your domestic tasks in outdoor costume, Nancy? -- {Dismissal, Belittiling}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you be so good as to come closer, Nancy, where I can see you. -- {Diminishing, Power games}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Have you any idea of the time of the day, or rather night, Nancy? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - you thought you saw me. Well, I certainly saw you. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Have you ever reflected, Nancy, that you are given a great deal of latitude in this house? -- {Patronizing, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Latitude, Nancy, means considerable liberty - liberty to the extent of two nights off a week. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, that's all very well. It is not so well, however, when you return as late as the master of the house. We ought to keep up some pretences, you know. -- {Accusation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (in a more human tone) Where the devil have you been tonight, anyway? -- {Accusation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, gentleman friends have been known to take decided liberties with young ladies like yourself. Are you alive to such a possibility? -- {Patronizing, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Nancy, pretty as your bonnet is, it is not anything near so pretty as your hair beneath it. Won't you take it off and let me see it? -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Possibly. Come here, will you, Nancy? -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Nancy, you are a very remarkable girl in many respects. I believe you are jealous of your mistress. -- {Patronizing, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why yes, Nancy, I believe it is. I think, however, don't you, that it would be better if you and I met one evening in different surroundings. -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Really, Nancy, you have taken me a little by surprise. I'll let you know tomorrow. -- {Manipulation, Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, I'll find a way. -- {Manipulation, Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: All right, Nancy. Now you had better go. I have some work to do. -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: There, run along. I have some work to do. -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - I'm going to write some letters. Go along, Nancy, that's a good girl. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go upstairs and take a message for me to Mrs Manningham. -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you please tell her that she is to come down here this instant, whether she is suffering from a sick headache or any other form of ailment. -- {Demanding, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: Just like that, Nancy. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (stepping forward) What do you mean, Nancy - she won't come? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Really? Then she forces me to be undignified. (He walks over to the door) All right, Nancy, leave it to me. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - really - the door is locked, is it? Very well... (He heads past her) -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Never mind. Just go and get it, will you? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Or on second thoughts perhaps you need not get the dog. We will just let it be supposed that we have the dog. That will be even more delicate still. (He holds out the note to Nancy) Here you are, Nancy. Please go and put this under the door. -- {Manipulation, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Never mind what I am going to write. I'll tell you what you can do though, Nancy. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nothing very much. Just a little smoke for getting rats out of holes. There. Run along. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go on, Nancy. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah - so I thought. Very well, Nancy. Now I shall be obliged if you will go to bed at once. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go to bed. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Good-night, Nancy. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: (indicating the chair he placed by the fireplace) Come and sit down in this chair, please, Bella. -- {Power games, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Dog? What dog? -- {Feigning ignorance, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: Again? This is strange talk, Bella - from you - after what you did to the dog a few weeks ago. Come and sit down there. -- {Gaslighting, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: The dog, my dear Bella, was merely a ruse to compel you to pay me a visit quietly. Come and sit down where I told you. -- {Manipulation, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: (shouting) Come and sit down where I told you! -- {Power games, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: Quite a good deal Bella. Sit down and make yourself comfortable. We have plenty of time. -- {Power games, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (calmly) Sit down and make yourself comfortable, Bella. We have plenty of time. -- {Power games, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now you are not sitting in the chair I indicated, Bella. -- {Power games, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. I thought I saw you, sir. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Did you, sir? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: I don't know, sir. I don't know what latitude means. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. We must. (She makes to go) -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Only with some friends, sir. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Oh, no, sir. Not with me. I can look after myself. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: No, sir, not always, perhaps. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Very good, sir. It comes off easy enough. (She takes her bonnet off) There ... Is there anything more you want, sir? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir ... (She moves to him) Is there anything you want, sir ...? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: There! Can she do that for you? Can she do that? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: You know who I mean all right. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: She? She's a poor thing. There's no need to be jealous of her. You want to kiss me again, don't you. Don't you want to kiss me? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: There! That's better than a sick headache - ain't it? - a sick headache and a pale face all the day. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. Where? I'll meet you when you like. You're mine now - ain't you? - 'cos you want me. You want me - don't you? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Oh, yes! I always wanted you, ever since I first clapped eyes on you. I wanted you more than all of them. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Oh, yes - there's plenty of others. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Where can we meet? Where do you want us to meet? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: How'll you let me know, when she's about? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Not that I care for her. I'd like to kiss you under her very nose. That's what I'd like to do. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Go? I don't want to go. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Work? What are you going to work at? What are you going to do? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Oh, very well, sir. You shall be master for a little more. (She kisses him) Good-night, your lordship. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: (moving to the door) When shall you let me know tomorrow? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Good-night! -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. What is it now? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. What do you want me to say? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Just like that, sir? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: She won't come. She doesn't mean to come. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: The door's locked. She's got it locked. I tried it. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: She won't let you in. I can tell by her voice. She's got it locked and she won't open it. Are you going to batter it in? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. I'll do that. What are you going to write? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes? What? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: The dog? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: What's the game? What's the idea with the dog? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: All right. (She moves to the door) -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: (after a pause; taking the letter) What's the idea? What have you written in this? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: You're arum beggar, ain't you? (She moves to the door) Can't I look? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: She's coming. It's done the trick all right. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Go on. What's the game? What's the row about? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: (comingforward to him) All right, I'm going. (She kisses him) Good night, old dear. Give her what-for, won't you? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Ta-ta. (She heads for the door) -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Perhaps you will let me pass, madam. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. What is it now? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. What do you want me to say? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Just like that, sir? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: She's coming. It's done the trick all right. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Go on. What's the game? What's the row about? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: (comingforward to him) All right, I'm going. (She kisses him) Good night, old dear. Give her what-for, won't you? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Ta-ta. (She heads for the door) -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Perhaps you will let me pass, madam. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Where is the dog? Where have you got the dog? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You said you had the dog. Have you hurt it? Let me have it. Where is it? Have you hurt it again? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I do not want to speak to you. I am not well. I thought you had the dog and were going to hurt it. That is why I came down. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. I want to go. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... Yes ... What do you want? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to go. You cannot keep me here. I want to go. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (going to a chair other than the one indicated and which is nearer the door) Say what you have to say. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Ignoring}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: I have to say that you are not sitting in the chair I indicated. Are you afraid of me that you desire to get so near the door? -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed. Then you have a good deal of courage, my dear. However, will you now sit down where I told you? -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you know what you remind me of, Bella, as you walk across the room? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Haven't you? Not that funny, glazed, dazed look of the wandering mind - the body that acts without the soul to guide it? I have often thought you had that look, but it's never been so strong as tonight. -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: No? When I came in, Bella, I was told that you had gone to bed. -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then may I ask why you are still fully dressed? -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then will you tell me why, since you had gone to bed. you are still fully dressed? -- {Accusation, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mr Manningham]: You don't know? Do you know anything about anything you do? -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You forgot to undress. A curious oversight, if I may say so, Bella. You know, you give me the appearance of having had a rather exciting time since I last saw you. Almost as though you have been up to something. Have you been up to something? -- {Accusation, Provocation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Am I married to a dumb woman, Bella, in addition to all else? The array of your physical and mental deficiencies is growing almost overwhelming. I advise you to answer me. -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: It is not necessary for you to tell me that, Bella. I am just wondering if it might interrupt its gyratory motion for a fraction of a second, and concentrate upon the present conversation. Now please, what was it I a moment ago asked you if you remembered? -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Admirable, my dear Bella! Admirable! We shall make a great logician of you yet - a Socrates - a John Stuart Mill! You shall go down to history as the shining mind of your day. That is, if your present history does not altogether submerge you - take you away from your fellow creatures. And there is a danger of that, you know, in more ways than one. Well - what did I say I would do if you did not find that bill? -- {Sarcasm, Belittling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. And do you believe me to be a man of my word? -- {Power games, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: You see, Bella, in a life of considerable and varied experience I have hammered out a few principles of action. In fact I actually fancy I know how to deal with my fellow men. I learned it quite early, actually - at school, in fact. There, you know, there were two ways of getting at what you wanted. One was along an intellectual plane, the other along the physical. If one failed one used the other. I took that lesson into life with me. Hitherto, with you, I have worked, with what forbearance and patience I leave you to judge, along the intellectual plane. The time has come now, I believe, to work along the other as well ... You will understand that I am a man of some power ... -- {Power games, Threats, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why do you look at me, Bella? I said I am a man of some power and determination, and as fully capable in one direction as in the other... I will leave your imagination to work on what I mean... However, we are really digressing ... You did not find the bill I told you to find. -- {Power games, Threats, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you look for it? (He moves towards the bureau) -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Around the room. Where around the room? (Pause) In my desk, for instance? -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you imagine you can lie to me? -- {Accusation, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, listen to me. Your dark, confused, rambling mind has led you into playing some pretty tricks tonight - has it not? -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Your mind is indeed tired. Your mind is so tired that it cannolongerworkatall. You do notthink. You dream. Dream all day long. Dream everything. Dream maliciously and incessantly. Don't you know that by now? You sleep-walking imbecile, what have you been dreaming tonight - where has your mind wandered - that you have split open my desk? What strange diseased dream have you had tonight - eh? -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure, Accusation, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: All that happened when, Bella? Tonight? Of course you dreamed all that happened - or rather all that didn't happen. -- {Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: Have I not told you ? -- {Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: (simultaneously) Sit down and be quiet. Sit down! -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: (more quietly and inquisitively) What was this dream of yours, Bella? You interest me. -- {Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (now very inquisitively) You dreamed of a man, Bella? What man did you dream of, pray? -- {Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: I know you dreamed it, you gibbering wretch! I want to know more about this man of whom you dreamed. Do you hear! Do you hear me! -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go to your room. I will call you down later. I have not finished with you yet, madam. -- {Power games, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: I shall find out the meaning of this, and deal with you in due course. -- {Threats}\n[Rough]: Well, who I am seems a little doubtful. Apparently I am a mere figment of Mrs Manningham's imagination. As for how I got in: I came in, or rather I came back - or better still, I effected an entrance a few minutes before you, and I have been hidden away ever since. -- {Gaslighting}\n[Rough]: (lighting a cigar) Ah - an admirable idea. I could have thought of nothing better myself. Yes, fetch a policeman, Manningham, and have me turned out... (Pause) Why do you wait? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (after a pause) You give me the impression, sir, that you have something up your sleeve. Will you go on with what you were saying? -- {Accusation}\n[Rough]: Yes, certainly. Where was I? Yes. (He pauses) Excuse me, Mr Manningham, but do you get the same impression as myself? -- {Gaslighting}\n\n\n[Rough]: Eerie, isn't it? Now we are almost in the dark... Why do you think that has happened? You don't suppose a light has been put on somewhere else ... You don't suppose that strangers have entered the house? You don't supposethereare other spirits - fellow spirits of mine - spirits surrounding this house now - spirits of justice, even, which have caught up with you at last, Mr Manningham? -- {Provocation, Accusation, Dramatization}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you off your head, sir? -- {Dismissal, Belittling}\n[Rough]: No, sir. Just an old man seeing ghosts. It must be the atmosphere of this house. (Walking about) I can see them everywhere. It's the oddest thing. Do you know one ghost I can see, Mr Manningham? You could hardly believe it. -- {Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Mr Manningham]: What ghost do you see, pray? -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Rough]: Why, it's the ghost of an old woman, sir - the ghost of an old woman twenty years ago - an old woman who once lived in this house, who once lived in this very room. Yes - in this very room. What things I imagine! -- {Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Mr Manningham]: What are you saying? -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Rough]: Remarkably clear, sir, I see it... An old woman getting ready to go to bed - here in this very room - an old woman getting ready to go up to bed at the end of the day. Why! There she is. She sits just there. And now it seems I see another ghost as well. -- {Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: (Looking at Mr Manningham) I see the ghost of a young man, Mr Manningham - a handsome, tall, well-groomed young man. But this young man has murder in his eyes. Why, God bless my soul, he might be you, Mr Manningham - he might be you! The old woman sees him. Don' t you see it all? She screams - screams for help - screams before her throat is cut - cut open with a knife. She lies dead on the floor - the floor of this room of this house. There! (Pause) Now I don't see that ghost any more. -- {Accusation, Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Mr Manningham]: What's the game - eh? What's the game? -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Rough]: (confronting Manningham) But I still see the ghost of the man. I see him, all through the night, as he ransacks the house, hour after hour, room after room, ripping everything up. turning everything out, madly seeking the thing he cannot find. Then twenty years pass, and where is he? Why, sir, is he not still in the same house, the house he ransacked, the house he searched - and does he not now stand before the ghost of the woman he killed, in the room in which he killed her? A methodical man, apatient man, but perhaps he has waited too long. For justice has waited too, and here she is, in my person, to exact her due. And justice found, my friend, in one hour what you sought for twenty years, and still could not find. See here. Look what she found. (He moves to the bureau and picks up the bill, the letter and the brooch as he mentions them) First a bill which your wife had lost. Then a letter which never reached your wife. Then a brooch which you gave your wife but which she lost. How wicked of her! But then she didn't know its value. How was she to know that it held the Barlow Rubies. There (He opens out the brooch) See. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! There you are, sir! You killed one woman for those and tried to drive another out of her mind. And all the time they lay in your own desk, and all they have brought you is a rope around your neck! Well, the game is over, Sydney Power, and I advise you to take the matter philosophically. -- {Accusation, Provocation, Dramatization, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: You seem, sir, to have some very remarkable information. Do you imagine you are going to leave this room with such information in your possession? (He moves to the door as though to lock it) -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Rough]: Do you imagine, sir, that you are going to leave this room without suitable escort? -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: May I ask what you mean by that? -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Rough]: Only that I have men in the house already. Didn't you realize that they had signalled their arrival from above, your own way in, Mr Manningham, when the light went down? -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Here you... What the devil's this? (He rushes to the door and opens it) -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah, gentlemen - come in. Come in. Make yourselves at home. Here. (He makes a plunge to escape) ' -- {Evasion, Attempt to escape}\n[Mr Manningham]: Leave go of me, will you? Here. Leave go of me! Here's a fine way of going on. Here's a fine way! -- {Evasion, Victim playing}\n[Rough]: (going up to Mr Manningham) Sydney Charles Power, I have a warrant for your arrest for the murder of Alice Barlow. I should warn you that anything you may say now may be taken down in writing and used as evidence at a later date. Will you accompany us to the station in a peaceful manner? You will oblige us all, and serve your own interests best, Power, by coming with us quietly ... -- {Accusation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham renews his struggle]: Very well - take him away ... -- {Evasion, Victim playing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Inspector Rough ... -- {Neutral}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) Yes, my dear, now don't you think you'd better ... -- {Patronizing, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (in a weak voice) Inspector ... -- {Neutral}\n[Rough]: Yes? -- {Neutral}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to my husband. -- {Neutral}\n[Rough]: Now, surely, there's nothing to be - - -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to my husband. -- {Neutral}\n[Rough]: Very well, my dear, what do you want to say? -- {Neutral}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to him alone. -- {Neutral}\n[Rough]: Alone? -- {Neutral}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, alone. Won't you please let me speak to him alone. I beg of you to allow me. I will not keep him long. -- {Neutral}\n[Rough]: (after a pause) I don't quite understand. Alone? (Pause) Very well. You may speak to him alone. (To the men) Very well. (He signals to the men that they are to tie Mr Manningham to the chair) -- {Neutral}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack! Jack! What have they done to you? What have they done? -- {Neutral}\n[Mr Manningham]: (struggling at his bonds, half-whispering) Take it easy, Bella. You're clever. Get something to cut this and I'll get away. I can get out through the dressing-room, and make a jump for it. Can you get something? -- {Manipulation, Deception}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, I can get something. What can I get? -- {Neutral}\n[Mr Manningham]: There's a razor in my dressing-room. In there! Quick! Be quick! Go and get it! -- {Manipulation, Deception}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. I will get it! I will get it for you. -- {Neutral}\n[Mr Manningham]: There's a good girl. You're a good girl. Quick! Be quick! -- {Manipulation, Deception}\n[Mrs Manningham]: How strange! The door is locked! -- {Neutral}\n[Mr Manningham]: What do you mean - locked? There's the key, there! I see it. Tum the key, and go in! -- {Manipulation, Deception}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Key? What key? You are not suggesting that this is a key I hold in my hand? Have you gone mad, my husband? (She hurls the key across the room) -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: What's the game, Bella? -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving to him) Or is it I who am mad? Yes. That is it. Of course. I am mad. It was a key, and I have lost it. Dear God - I have lost it, haven't I? I am always losing things. And I can never find them. I don't know where I put them. -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella ... -- {Neutral}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I must look for it, mustn't I? Yes... If I don't find it you will lock me in my room - you will lock me in the mad-house for my mischief. Where could it be now? Could it be behind the picture? Yes, it must be there. (She goes to the picture and takes it down) No - it is not there - how strange. I must put the picture back, mustn't I? I have taken it down, and I must put it back. There. (She puts the picture back) Where now shall I look? The desk. Perhaps I put it in the desk. (She goes to the desk) No, it is not here. (She picks up the bill, the letter and the watch as she mentions them) Here is a bill. Here is a letter. Here is a watch. See. (She moves to him, the items in her hand) Take them. I have found them at last, you see! But they don't help you, do they? And I am trying to help you, aren't I? To help you to escape ... But how can a mad woman help her husband to escape? What a pity ... (Getting louder and louder) If I were not mad I could have helped you - if I were not mad, whatever you had done, I could have pitied and protected you! But because I am mad I have hated you, and because I am mad I have betrayed you, and because I am mad I am rejoicing with my heart - without a shred of pity - without a shred of regret - watching you go with glory in my heart! (She pauses, looking at him. She breathes deeply. She suddenly goes to the door UL and flings it open) Inspector! Inspector! Come and take this man away! Come and take this man away! -- {Accusation, Provocation, Dramatization, Blaming}\n[Rough]: Now, my dear, come and sit down. Well, my child, there's all your life ahead now. It's Devonshire cream for you, and the sparkle back in your eyes. But you've had a bad time. I came in from nowhere and gave you the most horrible evening of your life, didn't I? The most horrible evening of anybody's life, I should imagine. -- {Patronizing, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: The most horrible ... Oh, no ... (With a sort of proud defiance) The most wonderful... Far and away the most wonderful. -- {Neutral}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: What are you doing, Bella? -- {Ignoring, Evasion, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Nothing, dear... (She moves back to the window to look out) Don't wake yourself. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (closing his eyes again) What are you doing, Bella? Come here ... -- {Ignoring, Evasion, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now then, Bella. We've had this out before. Be so good as to ring the bell. -- {Dismissal, Dismissing, Invalidation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go and ring the bell, please, Bella - there's a good child. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: What do you suppose the servants are for, Bella? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go on. Answer me. What do you suppose servants are for? -- {Provocation, Baiting}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have no doubt of it, my dear. It's sheer weak mindedness to think otherwise. -- {Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You're looking very impudent and pretty this afternoon, Nancy. Do you know that? -- {Patronizing, Making another person feel inadequate}\n[Mr Manningham]: Or are women too jealous of their discoveries to pass them on to a rival? -- {Provocation, Baiting}\n[Mr Manningham]: But, my dear, you're the mistress of the house. It was your business to tell her to put the coal on. -- {Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Mr Manningham]: But you seem to look upon the servants as our natural equals. So I treated her as one. -- {Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Laughs at you? What an idea. What makes you think she laughs at you? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: But, my dear- if she does that, doesn't the fault lie with you? -- {Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't mean anything. It's you who read meanings into everything, Bella dear. I wish you weren't such a perfect little silly. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: I not only would take you to see MacNaughton, my dear. I am going to take you to see MacNaughton. That is, if you want to go. -- {Manipulation, Creating artificial obligations}\n[Mr Manningham]: Which would you choose. Bella - the comedy or the tragedy? -- {Manipulation, Creating artificial obligations}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well - it depends - doesn't it - upon whether you want to laugh, or whether you want to cry. -- {Manipulation, Creating artificial obligations}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, my dear, you've been very good lately, and I thought it would be well to take you out of yourself. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, Jack dear. You have been so much kinder lately. Is it possible you're beginning to see my point of view? -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't know that I ever differed from it, did I, Bella? -- {Gaslighting, Denying}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, Jack dear. It's true. It's true. All I need is to be taken out of myself - some little changes - to have some attention from you. Oh, Jack, I'd be better - I could really try to be better - you know in what way - if only I could get out of myself a little more. -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: How do you mean, my dear, exactly, better? -- {Invalidation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, no - don't let's speak about that. -- {Ignoring, Changing the topic}\n[Mr Manningham]: I wonder if it is that - or whether it's merely that your medicine is beginning to benefit you? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well - we are talking about gloomy subjects, aren't we? -- {Changing the topic, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, dear. Don't I seem to? Haven't I just said I'm taking you to the theatre? -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, then, which is it to be - the comedy or the tragedy? You must make up your mind. -- {Dismissal, Being abrupt}\n[Mr Manningham]: My dear - what are you doing? -- {Patronizing, Judging}\n[Mr Manningham]: But what has she done? -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: I think you imagine things, my dear. -- {Gaslighting, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: You seem wonderfully pleased with yourself, Bella. I must take you to the theatre more often, if this is the result. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: A paradise of which you would soon tire, my dear. I have no doubt that after a few nights you would be staying at home again, just as you do now. -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: There would be hussies after me, would there? That is an added inducement, then. -- {Provocation, Dismissing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (suddenly rising, looking at the wall opposite him; in a calm, yet menacing voice) I don't know, I'm sure ... I don't know ... -- {Abrupt reaction, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know perfectly well what has happened, Bella, and if you will rectify it at once I will say no more about it. -- {Gaslighting, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you trying to make a fool of me, Bella? What I refer to is on the wall behind you. If you will put it back, I will forget the matter. -- {Gaslighting, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Why has it been taken down? Why, indeed? You alone can answer that, Bella. Why was it taken down before? Will you please take it from wherever you have hidden it, and put it back on the wall again. -- {Accusation, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: Someone else? Are you suggesting that I should play such a fantastic and wicked trick? -- {Gaslighting, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Someone else, eh? Someone else. (Shaking her off ) Will you leave go of me. You repel me - you half-witted thing. (He walks over to the bell-cord) We will see about \"someone else\". -- {Gaslighting, Accusation, Disrespect, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: (shaking her off violently) Will you leave go of me and sit down there! (He moves to the fireplace) Someone else - eh? Well - we shall see. -- {Ignoring boundaries, Threats, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: You had better pull yourself together, hadn't you ... ? -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah, Elizabeth, do you notice anything amiss in this room? Look carefully around the walls, and see if you notice anything amiss ... Well, Elizabeth, what do you notice? -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Exactly. The picture has been taken down. You noticed it at once. Now was that picture in its place when you dusted the room this morning? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Neither do I, Elizabeth, neither do I. And now, before you go, just one question. Was it you who removed that picture, Elizabeth? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed, why should you? And now please, will you kiss that Bible, which lies on that desk there, as a token of your truthfulness... -- {Manipulation, Creating artificial obligations}\n[Mr Manningham]: Very well, you may go. And please send Nancy in here at once. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you have the goodness to contain yourself? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I did not ask for any comment on your part, Nancy. Kindly be less insolent and answer what I ask you. Did you take that picture down, or did you not? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: That is all, Nancy. You may go. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: For God's sake be careful what you do. Do you desire to commit sacrilege above all else? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then, by God, you are mad, and you don't know what you do. You unhappy wretch - you're stark gibbering mad - like your wretched mother before you. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing, Accusation, Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: (after a pause) The time has come to face facts, Bella. If this progresses you will not be much longer under my protection. -- {Threats, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella, my dear - have you any idea where that picture is now? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then you did know where it was, Bella. You did know where it was. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: There is no sense in walking about the room with a picture in your hand, Bella. Go and put it back in its proper place. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, Bella, I said a moment ago that we have got to face facts. And that is what we have got to do. I am not going to say anything at the moment for my feelings are running too high. In fact, I am going out immediately, and I suggest that you go to your room and lie down for a little in the dark. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing, Ignoring relation repair attempts}\n[Mr Manningham]: There is no question of sending you to your room, Bella. You know perfectly well that you may do exactly as you please. Everything - - -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, my dear, I am going to leave you in peace ... -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, no argument, please. I had to go in any case after tea, and I am merely leaving a little earlier, that's all. (He puts on his hat and coat. Pause) Now, is there anything I can get for you? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (simultaneously) My dear. Calm yourself. Calm yourself. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (coming to her and shaking her violently) Will you control yourself! Will you control yourself! Listen to me, madam, if you utter another sound I'll knock you down and take you to your room and lock you in darkness for a week. I have been too lenient with you, and I mean to alter my tactics. -- {Threats, Aggression, Harsh startup}\n[Mr Manningham]: May God help you, indeed. Now listen to me. I am going to leave you until ten o'clock. In that time you will recover that paper, and admit to me that you have lyingly and purposely concealed it... If not, you will take the consequences. You are going to see a doctor, madam, more than one doctor - and they shall decide what this means. Now do you understand me? -- {Threats, Dismissal, Diminishing, Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: (moving to the door) I have been patient with you and controlled myself long enough. It is no w for you to control yourself, or take the consequences. Think upon that, Bella. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing, Ignoring relation repair attempts}\n[Mr Manningham]: What a question to ask me at such a time. No, madam, emphatically I am not. You play fair by me, and I'll play fair by you. If we are going to be enemies, you and I, you will find that it is I who shall get the best of it. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing, Threats}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving to Mr Manningham) Jack - spare me that girl. Don't call her in. I'll say anything. I'll say that I did it. I did it, Jack, I did it. Don't have that girl in. Don't! -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (Picking up the Bible to put it back in its place) There! I think we may now be said to have demonstrated conclusively - - -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (rising) Give me that Bible! Give it to me! Let me kiss it, too! (She snatches itfrom him) There! (She kisses it) There! Do you see? -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It is no sacrilege, Jack. Someone else has committed sacrilege. Now see - I swear before God Almighty that I never touched that picture. (She kisses the Bible) There! -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack - you promised you would never say that again. -- {Victim playing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack - I'm going to make a last appeal to you. I'm going to make a last appeal. I'm desperate, Jack. Can' t you see that I'm desperate? If you can't, you must have a heart of stone. -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack, I may be going mad. like my poor mother - but if I am mad you have to treat me gently. Jack - before God - I never lie to you knowingly. If I have taken down that picture I have not known it. I have not known it. If I took it down on those other occasions I did not know it, either ... Jack, if I steal your things - your rings - your keys - your pencils and your handkerchiefs, and you find them later at the bottom of my box, as indeed you do, then I do not know that I have done it... Jack - if I commit these fantastic, meaningless mischiefs - so meaningless - why should I take a picture down from its place? If I do all these things, then I am certainly going off my head, and must be treated kindly and gently so that I may get well. You must bear with me, Jack, bear with me - not storm and rage. God knows I'm try ing. Jack, I'm try ing! Oh, for God's sake believe that I'm trying, and be kind to me! -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (vaguely) Yes ... Yes... -- {Victim playing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No! No! I only supposed it was! I only supposed it was because it was found there before! It was found there twice before. Don't you see? I didn 't know - I didn' t! (She moves towards him with the picture in her hand) -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, look at our tea ... We were having our tea with muffins ... -- {Victim playing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving DS of the table) No, no - not my room. For God's sake don't send me to my room! -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I feel faint, Jack ... I feel faint... -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (reclining, her eyes closed) Have you got to go? Must you go? Must you always leave me alone after these dreadful scenes? -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (half-rising; suspiciously) Jack, I'm quite sure it is there. Will you look carefully? -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (searching frantically) I laid it out here myself! Where is it? (Opening and shutting drawers) Where is it? Now you're going to say I've hidden this! -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (sinking to her knees) Oh, God help me! God help me! -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, God - be patient with me. If I am mad, be patient with me. -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack... Jack... Don't go ... Jack ... You're still going to take me to the theatre, aren't you? -- {Victim playing, Dramatization}\n\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes!... Yes!... What is it. Elizabeth? Leave me alone. -- {Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: Madam, there's somebody called. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Who is it? I don't want to be disturbed. -- {Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: It's a gentleman, madam - he wants to see you. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Tell him to go. Elizabeth. He wants to see my husband. My husband's out. -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Elizabeth]: No, madam - he wants to see you. You must see him, madam. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, leave me alone. Tell him to go away. I want to be left alone. -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Elizabeth]: Madam, madam. I don't know what's going on between you and the master, but you've got to hold up, madam. You've got to hold up. -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I am going out of my mind, Elizabeth. That's what's going on. -- {Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Don't talk like that, madam. You've got to be brave. You mustn't go on lying here in the dark, or your mind will go. You must see this gentleman. It's you he wants - not the master. He's waiting below. Come, madam, it'll take you out of yourself. -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, my God - what new torment is this? I'm not in a fit state, I tell you. -- {Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Come, madam. I'll turn up the light. (She does so) There. Now you'll be all right. -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (sitting up on the settee) Elizabeth! What have you done? I can't have anyone in. I'm not fit to be seen. -- {Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: You look all right, madam. You mustn't take on so. Now - I'll call him up. -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Rough]: You're a good deal younger and more attractive than I thought, you know. But you're looking very pale. Have you been crying? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Really - I'm afraid I don't understand at all. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: You will do so, madam, very shortly. (He moves L and removes his scarf during the following) You're the lady who's going off her head, aren't you? -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving towards him) What made you say that? Who are you? What have you come to talk about? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (taking off his coat and putting it on a chair) Well, of one thing you can be certain. I have not come to talk about the weather. Though that indeed merits a world of comment at the moment. But you're running away with things, Mrs Manningham, and asking me a good deal I can't answer at once. Instead of that, I am going to ask you a question or two ... Now, please, will you come here and give me your hands? -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Rough]: Now, Mrs Manningham, I want you to take a good look at me, and see if you are not looking at someone to whom you can give your trust. I am a perfect stranger to you, and you can read little in my face besides that. But I can read a great deal in yours. -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) What? What can you read in mine? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Why, madam. I can read the tokens of one who has travelled a very long way upon the path of sorrow and doubt - and will have, I fear, to travel a little further before she comes to the end. But I fancy she is coming towards the end, for all that. Come now. are you going to trust me, and listen to me? I'm old enough to be your grandfather. -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Who are you? God knows I need help. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: I very much doubt whether God knows anything of the sort, Mrs Manningham. Had he done so I believe he would have come to your aid before this. But I am here, and so you must give me your faith. -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Who are you? Are you a doctor? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Nothing so learned, ma'am. Just a plain police detective. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Police detective? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Yes. Or was ten years ago. At any rate, still detective enough to see that you've been interrupted in your tea. Couldn't you start again, and let me have a cup? -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Why, yes - yes. I will give you a cup. It only wants water. (She busies her self with hot water, cup, teapot, etcetera, throughout the ensuing conversation) -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (fetching a chair and bringing it to the table) You never heard of the celebrated Sergeant Rough, madam? Sergeant Rough, who solved the Claudesley Diamond Case - Sergeant Rough, who hunted down the Camberwell Dogs - Sergeant Rough, who brought Sandham himself to justice ... (He puts his hand on the back of the chair, and looks at her) Or were all such sensations before your time? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Sandham? Why, yes, I have heard of Sandham - the murderer, the throttler. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Yes, madam, Sandham the Throttler. And you are now looking at the man who gave Sandham to the man who throttled him. And that was the common hangman. In fact, Mrs Manningham, you have in front of you one who was quite a personage in his day - believe it or not. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I quite believe it. Won't you sit down? I'm afraid it won' t be very hot. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Thank you... How long have you been married, Mrs Manningham? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Seven years - and a little. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Where have you lived during all that time, Mrs Manningham? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (putting milk in Rough's cup and passing it to him) Why ... First we went abroad - then we lived in Yorkshire, and then six months ago my husband took this house. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (taking the cup) Thank you ... And does your husband always leave you alone like this in the evenings? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. He goes to his club, I believe, and does business. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (stirring his tea; thoughtfully) So you believe. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: And does your husband give you a free run of the whole house while he's out? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... Well, no... Not the top floor. Why do you ask? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Ah - not the top floor ... -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No... no... Will you have some sugar? What were you saying? (She sits, bending over eagerly to answer his questions) -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Before I go any further, Mrs Manningham, I must tell you there's a leakage in this household. You have a maid called Nancy? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... Yes... -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: And Nancy walks out of an evening with a young man named Booker in my employ. I only live a few streets away from you, you know. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, yes? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Well, there is hardly anything which goes on in this house which is not described in detail to Booker, and from that quarter it reaches me. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I knew it! I knew she talked. Now I know it, she shall be dismissed. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Oh, no - no such retribution is going to overtake her at the moment, Mrs Manningham. In fact, I fancy you are going to be heavily in debt to your maid, Nancy. If it were not for her indiscretions I should not be here now, should I? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What do you mean? What is this mystery? You must not keep me in the dark. What is it? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: I'm afraid I shall have to keep you in the dark for a little, Mrs Manningham, as I am still quite far down in the dark myself. Can I have another lump of sugar in this? -- {Patronizing, Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. (She passes the sugar bowl to him) -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Thank you. We were talking about the top floor. (Helping himself to several lumps) There is a bedroom above this, and above that again is the top floor? Is that right? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Now - have you ever been up to that top floor? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. Never ... It's shut up. My husband has forbidden it. No-one goes up there. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Not even a servant to dust. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Rather funny? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Yes. (Pause) Yes, indeed ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Yes. Now, Mrs Manningham, to ask a personal question: when did you first get the notion into your head that your reason was playing you tricks? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) How did you know? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Never mind how I know. How did it begin? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I always had that dread. My mother died insane, when she was quite young. When she was my age. But only in the last six months, in this house - things began to happen - - -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Which are driving you mad with fear? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. Which are driving me mad with fear. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Is it the house itself you fear, Mrs Manningham? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. I suppose it is. I hate the house. I always did. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: And has the top floor got anything to do with it? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, yes, it has. How did you know? That's how all this dreadful horror began. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Ah - now you interest me beyond measure. Do tell me about the top floor. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I don't know what to say. It all sounds incredible... It's when I'm alone at night. I get the idea that - somebody's walking about up there ... (Shepoints up) Up there ... At night, when my husband's out - I hear noises, from my bedroom, but I'm too afraid to go up ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Have you told your husband about this? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. I'm afraid to. He gets angry. He says I imagine things which don't exist. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: It never struck you, did it, that it might be your own husband walking about up there? -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes - that is what I thought - but I thought I must be mad. Tell me how you knew. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: Why not tell me first how you knew, Mrs Manningham. -- {Evasion, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It's true, then! I knew it. I knew it! When he leaves this house he comes back. He comes back and walks up there above - up and down - up and down. He comes back like a ghost. How does he get up there? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: Now please don't look so frightened. Your husband is no ghost, believe me, and you are very far from mad. Tell me now, what made you first think it was him? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It was the light - the gaslight ... It went down and it went up ... Oh, thank God I can tell this to someone at last. I don't know who you are, but I must tell you. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: Now try to keep calm. You can tell me just as well sitting down, can't you? Won't you sit down? -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: How very strange, indeed. You know. Mrs Manningham, you should have been a policeman. -- {Dismissal, Belittiling}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Are you laughing at me? Do you think I imagine everything too? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: Oh no! I was merely praising the keenness of your observation. I not only think you are right in your suppositions, I think you have made a very remarkable discovery, and one which may have very far-reaching consequences. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I begin to doubt, don't you see? I begin to believe I imagine everything. Perhaps I do. Are you here? Is this a dream, too? Who are you? I'm afraid they are going to lock me up. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: (putting his hands on hers) Do you know, Mrs Manningham, it has occurred to me that you'd be all the better for a little medicine. -- {Patronizing, Dismissing}\n[Rough]: You shall sample it and see. (He rises and goes over to his coat) You see, it has been employed by humanity, for several ages, for the purpose of the instantaneous removal of dark fears and doubt. That seems to fit you. doesn't it? -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Whisky? But I must not take whisky. I can't do that! -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: (pouring two whiskies) You underestimate your powers, Mrs Manningham. You see, I don't want you thinking you can't trust your reason. This will give you faith in your reason like nothing else... -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: Ah. \"The Cabman's Friend\". (He moves to the mantelpiece) You should ask me who was \"The Cabman's Friend\", Mrs Manningham, for she was an old lady who died many, many years ago. (He puts his whisky on the mantelpiece) -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n[Mrs Manningham]: An old lady years ago? What has she to do with me? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: A great deal, I fancy, if you will follow me patiently. Her name was Barlow - Alice Barlow, and she was an old lady of great wealth, and decided eccentricities. -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, how horrible! Do you mean she was murdered? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: Yes. She was murdered. I was only a comparatively young officer at the time, but it made an extremely horrible, in fact I may say lasting, impression on me. -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But what - - ? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: There were some sensational features about the case. -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What were your theories? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: Well, it seemed to me, from all that I gathered here and there, that the old lady might have been an eccentric, but that she was by no means a fool. -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, how horrible! How horrible indeed. And was the man ever found? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: No, Mrs Manningham, the man was never found. Nor has the Barlow jewellery ever come to light. -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n\n[Rough]: I think he is almost certainly alive today, but I don't believe he found what he wanted. That is, if my theory is right. -- {Diminishing, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Then the jewels may still be where the old lady hid them? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Indeed, Mrs Manningham, if my theory is right, the jewels must still be where she hid them, but then, of course, it was only a theory and that formed in quite a young man, long enough ago. The official conclusion was quite otherwise. The police, naturally and quite excusably presumed that the murderer had got them, and there was no re-opening of matters in those days. Soon enough the public forgot about it. I forgot about it myself. But it would be funny, wouldn't it, Mrs Manningham, if after all these years I should turn out to be right. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing, Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, yes, indeed. But what has this to do with me? -- {Ignoring, Not caring}\n[Rough]: Ah, that is the whole question, Mrs Manningham. What, indeed? What has the obscure murder of an old lady twenty years ago to do with an attractive, though I am afraid at present somewhat pale and wan young lady in this house, who believes she is going out of her mind, and watches the gaslight going up and down when her husband is out at night? Well, I believe there is a link, however remote, wild and strange it may be, and that is why I am here. -- {Guilt tripping, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It's all so confusing. Won't you - - -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Do you conceive it possible, Mrs Manningham, that that man might not have given up hope of one day getting at the treasure which lay there, and have bided his time until he could somehow re-enter the house? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: You know, Mrs Manningham, of the old theory that the criminal always returns to the scene of his crime. Ah, yes, but in this case there is something more than morbid compulsion. There is treasure there to be unearthed if only he can search again, search methodically, without fear of interruption, without causing suspicion. And how would he do that? Don't you think ... -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Rough]: What's the matter, Mrs Manningham? -- {Ignoring, Not caring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Quiet! Be quiet! He has come back! Look! Look at the light! It is going down! Wait! -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Dear me, now. How very odd that is. How very odd, indeed. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: He is in the house, I tell you. You must go. He will know you are here. You must go. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: How dark it is. You could hardly see to read. -- {Ignoring, Not caring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You must go. He is in the house. Please go. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Quiet, Mrs Manningham, quiet! You have got to keep your head. Don't you see my meaning, yet? Don't you understand that this was the house? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mrs Manningham]: House? What house? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: The old woman's house, Mrs Manningham. This house, here, these rooms, these walls. Twenty years ago Alice Barlow lay dead in this room. Twenty years ago the man who murdered her ransacked this house - below and above - but could not find what he sought. What if he is still searching, Mrs Manningham? What if he is up there - still searching? Now do you see why you must keep your head? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But my husband, my husband is up there! -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Precisely that, Mrs Manningham. Your husband. (He fetches the glass of whiskyfrom the mantelpiece) You see, I am afraid you are married to a tolerantly dangerous gentleman. Now drink this quickly, as we have a great deal to do. (He holds out the glass to her) -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves, Making others more dependent on them}\n[Mrs Manningham]: This house ... How do you know this was the house? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Why, ma'am, because I was on the case, and came here myself, that's all. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: The idea is mad, mad. I have been married seven years. How can you imagine my husband is - what you imagine he may be? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (pouring himself another whisky) When the police came into this place twenty years ago, as you can understand there was a lot of routine work to be done - interviewing of relatives and friends and so forth. Most of that was left to me. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Well? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Well, amongst all the acquaintances and relatives, nephews and nieces, et cetera, that I interviewed, there happened to be a young man by the name of Sydney Power. I suppose you have never heard that name at all, have you? -- {Making others more dependent on them for information, Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Power? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Yes. Sydney Power. It conveys nothing to you? -- {Making others more dependent on them for information, Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Sydney Power. No ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Well, he was a kind of distant cousin apparently much attached to the old lady, and even assisting her in her good works. The only thing was that I remembered his face. Well. I saw that face again about five weeks ago. It took me a whole day to discover where I had seen it before, but I remembered it at last. -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Well - what of it? What if you did remember him? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: It was not so much my remembering Mr Sydney Power, Mrs Manningham. What startled me was the lady on his arm, and the locality in which I saw him. -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh - who was the lady on his arm? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: You were the lady on his arm, Mrs Manningham, and you were walking down this street. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What are you saying? Do you mean you think my husband - my husband is this Mr Power? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Well, not exactly, for if my theories are right - - -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What are you saying? You stand there talking riddles. You are so cold. You are as heartless and cold as he is. -- {Ignoring, Accusation}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) No, Mrs Manningham, I am not cold, and I am not talking riddles. I am just trying to preserve a cold and calculating tone, because you are up against the most awful moment in your life, and your whole future depends on what you are going to do in the next hour. Nothing less. You have got to strike for your freedom, and strike now, for the moment may not come again. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves, Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Strike - - -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: You are not going out of your mind, Mrs Manningham, you are slowly, methodically, systematically being driven out of your mind. And why? Because you are married to a criminal maniac who is afraid you are beginning to know too much - a criminal maniac who steals back to his own house at night, still searching for something he could not find twenty years ago. Those are the facts, wild and incredible as they may seem. His name is no more Manningham than mine is. He is Sydney Power and he murdered Alice Barlow in this house. He changed his name, and he has waited all these years, until he found it safe to acquire this house in a legal way. He then acquired the empty house next door. Every night, for the last few weeks, he has entered that house from the back, climbed up on to its roof and come into this house by the skylight. I know that because I have seen him do it. You have watched the gaslight, and been aware of the same thing. He is up there now. Why he should employ this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting at what he wants, God himself only knows. For the same reason, perhaps, that he employs this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting rid of you: that is by slowly driving you mad and sending you into a lunatic asylum. Thank God you are not married to him, and that I have come here to save you from the workings of his wicked mind. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves, Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Not married? Not married? He married me. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: I have no doubt he did, Mrs Manningham. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, he contracted the same sort of union with another lady many years before he met you. Moreover the lady is still alive, and the English law has a highly exacting taste in monogamy. You see, I have been finding things out about Mr Sydney Power. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves, Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Are you speaking the truth? My God - are you speaking the truth? Where is his wife now? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: If my guesses are right, she is the length of the world away - on the continent of Australia to be precise, where I know for a fact he spent five years. Did you know that? -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. I did not know that. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Ah, yes. If only I could find her, everything would be easier, and that's the whole root of the matter, Mrs Manningham. So far I am only dealing in guesses and half facts. I have got to have evidence, and that is why I came to see you. You have got to give me the evidence or help me find it. -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: This is my husband. Don't you understand - this is my husband. He married me. Do you ask me to betray the man who married me? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: By which you mean, of course, the man who has betrayed you into thinking that you are married to him - don't you? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But I'm married to him. You must go. I must think this out. You must go. I must cling to the man I married. Mustn't I? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Indeed, cling to him by all means, but do not imagine you are the only piece of ivy. You can cling to him if you desire, as his fancy women cling to him in the low resorts of the town. That is the sort of wall you have to cling to, ma'am. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves, Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Women? What are you suggesting? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: I'm not suggesting anything. I am only telling you what I have seen. He comes to life at night, this gentleman upstairs, in more ways than one. I have made it my business to follow him on some of his less serious excursions, and I can promise you he has a taste in unemployed actresses which he is at no pains to conceal. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves, Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Is this the truth? Are you telling me the truth? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham - will you look me in the eyes again, and see if you think I am telling you the truth? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Yes. I have known it. How strange that is ... I have known it all along ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham, it is hard to take everything from you, but you are no more tied to this man. you are under no more obligation to him than those wretched women in those places. You must learn to be thankful for that. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves, Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What do you want me to do? What do you want? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (completely changing his tone, striding up and down in a business like way) I want his papers, Mrs Manningham - his identity. There is some clue somewhere in this house, and we have got to get at it. Where does he keep his papers? -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Papers? I know of no papers. Unless his bureau ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Yes. His bureau? His bureau? -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n\n[Rough]: Ah - he keeps it always locked, does he? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: (moving L) Very well. We will have a look inside. -- {Ignoring, Disregarding boundaries}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But it is locked. How can you, if it is locked? -- {Questioning}\n[Rough]: Oh - it doesn't look so formidable. (He fetches a ring of keys and implementsfrom his overcoat pocket during the following) You know, Mrs Manningham, one of the greatest regrets of my life is that fate never made me one of two things: one was a gardener, the other a burglar - both quiet occupations, Mrs Manningham. As for the last, if I'd started young, and worked my way up, I should have been a genius. Now let's have a look at this. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But you must not touch this. He will know what you have done. -- {Warning}\n[Rough]: Come now, ma'am. You're working with me, aren't you - not against me? (He looks at the bureau) Yes ... Yes... Now do you mind if I take off my coat? I'm a man who never feels at work until his coat's off. (He takes off his jacket, revealing a pink fancy shirt) Quite a saucy shirt, don't you think? You didn 't suspect I was such a dandy, did you? Now. (He goes over to the bureau) Let's have a real look at this. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But you must not tamper with that. He will know what you have done. -- {Warning}\n[Rough]: Not if we are clever enough. And this one here doesn't even ask for cleverness ... You see, Mrs Manningham, there are all manner of -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Elizabeth, you and I have got to do a little quite calm, but rather quick, thinking. Are you anxious to help your mistress, Elizabeth? -- {Manipulation}\n[Elizabeth]: Yes, sir. But you see - - -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Are you anxious to help your mistress, blindly, without asking any questions? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Rough]: (kindly taking her hand) Come now, Elizabeth. Are you or are you not? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Good. Now, Elizabeth, Mrs Manningham and I have reason to suppose that in about five minutes' time the master is returning to this house. I do not think it is advisable to leave the house at the moment, as I might be seen doing so by the master. Would you be good enough to take me down to your kitchen and hide me away for a short space of time? You can put me in the oven if you like. -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Rough]: All right. All right. That's better news. But it means you can't entertain me in the kitchen. (He goes to the window) Now where are you going to hide me, Elizabeth? Make up your mind quickly, as time is getting rather short. -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Rough]: (really excited for the first time) Yes, quick. He's coming. Don't you understand. Go there and stay there. Take her, Elizabeth. You have a bad headache - a bad headache. (Turning from the gaslight; quite angrily) Will you take her, in heaven's name! -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: Where is Mrs Manningham, Elizabeth? -- {Questioning}\n[Elizabeth]: I think she's gone to bed, sir. I think she had a bad headache and went to bed. -- {Lying}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, indeed. And how long has the good lady been in bed, do you know? -- {Questioning}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh. I see. Then we must be quiet, mustn't we? Walk about like cats ... Can you walk about like a cat, Elizabeth? -- {Patronizing, Ridiculing}\n[Elizabeth]: (trying to smile) Yes, sir. I think so, sir. -- {Feigning ignorance}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Why haven't you cleared away the tea things? -- {Questioning, Accusing}\n[Elizabeth]: Oh - I'm sorry, sir. I was really just about to, sir. -- {Apologizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I think you had better clear away the tea things, Elizabeth. -- {Demanding}\n[Elizabeth]: Yes, sir. -- {Complying}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, I am having it out. I have come back to change my linen. (He undoes his collar) -- {Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Elizabeth]: (stopping again) Do you want a fresh collar, sir? Shall I get you a fresh collar? -- {Questioning}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why, do you know where my collars are kept? -- {Questioning}\n[Elizabeth]: Why yes, sir. In your room, there, sir. Shall I get you one, sir? -- {Offering help}\n[Mr Manningham]: What a lot you know, Elizabeth. And do you know the sort of collar I want tonight? -- {Patronizing}\n[Elizabeth]: Why, yes, sir ... I think I know the sort of collar, sir ... -- {Feigning ignorance}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Then all I can say is you know a great deal more than I do ... No ... I think you must let me choose my own collar ... (He moves towards the door R and stops) That is, if I have your permission, Elizabeth. -- {Diminishing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: What did you think about Mrs Manningham tonight, Elizabeth? -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - just as regards her general health, Elizabeth. -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. I doubt if you guess to what extent she is unwell. Or are you beginning to guess? -- {Manipulation, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: I'm afraid I was compelled to drag you and Nancy into our troubles tonight. Perhaps I should not have done that. -- {Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Mr Manningham]: (smiling; somewhat appealingly) I'm at my wits' end, Elizabeth. Don't you know that? -- {Manipulation, Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have tried everything. Kindness, patience, cunning - even harshness, to bring her to her senses. But nothing will stop these wild, wild hallucinations, nothing will stop these wicked pranks and tricks. -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: You don't know a quarter of it, Elizabeth. You only see what is forced upon your attention - as it was tonight. You have no conception of what goes on all the time. (He looks at his tie) No - not this one, I think ... (He undoes if) -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: I suppose you know about Mrs Manningham's mother, Elizabeth. -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: She died in the mad-house, Elizabeth, without any brain at all in the end. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, don't you, that I shall have to bring a doctor to Mrs Manningham before long, Elizabeth? I have fought against it to the last, but it can't be kept a secret much longer. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: I mean to say, you know what goes on. You can testify to what goes on, can't you? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed, you may have to testify in the end. Do you realize that? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: (putting on his jacket, hat and coat) Yes, I believe you there, Elizabeth. You're a very good soul. I sometimes wonder how you put up with things in this household - this dark household. I wonder why you do not go. You're very loyal. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: There now, how touching. I thank you, Elizabeth. You will be repaid later for what you have said, and repaid in more ways than one. You understand that, don't you? -- {Manipulation, Creating artificial obligations}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, I know that. Well, Elizabeth, I am going out. In fact, I' m even going to try and be a little gay. Can you understand that, or do you think it is wrong? -- {Manipulation, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: I wonder... Yes... I wonder - it's a curious existence, isn't it? Well - good-night, Elizabeth. (He heads for the door) -- {Manipulation, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: He was right when he said you would be repaid, Elizabeth. Though not in the way he thinks. (He takes off his overcoat. Pause) Will you go and get Mrs Manningham? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Now I'm afraid you're one ahead of me, Mrs Manningham. -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Just a bill, I fancy. -- {Feigning ignorance}\n[Rough]: Poor thing. Poor thing. You shall have your Devonshire cream, my dear, and you shall have your fresh air to bring the sparkle back into your eyes. Why, I can see a sparkle in them already. If you will be brave now, you will not have to wait so long. Are you going to be brave? -- {Manipulation, Convincing to give up something important}\n[Rough]: I have no idea what you will say when he comes back, Mrs Manningham. But then I have no idea what you will do when he comes back, Mrs Manningham, if I have no evidence to remove you from his loving care for good. -- {Manipulation, Making another person feel inadequate}\n\n\n[Rough]: There is only one thing we can do - go ahead. If we go back now, we are lost. I am going to force it and gamble on finding something. Are you with me? -- {Diminishing, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But don't you see... All right. Force it. Force it. But be quick. -- {Dismissal, Not offering constructive solutions}\n[Rough]: (working on the lock) There's no hurry, ma'am. He's quite happy where he is... Now I don't like - (straining at the lock) violent methods - of this sort - it makes me feel like a dentist... There ... -- {Diminishing, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Is there anything in there? Is there anything there? -- {Impatience}\n[Rough]: Nothing at present, I' m afraid... Nothing at present... Wait a minute ... No ... No ... (Looking at a document) What's this? -- {Evasion, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Rough]: (looking more closely) One moment... No ... Not a thing. We have lost our gamble, ma'am, I'm afraid. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Rough]: Some rapid thinking at the moment. Don't have any fear, Mrs Manningham, I've been in many a tighter corner than this. Let's get these things back to begin with, shall we? Give me the watch and the brooch. We must put them back where they were. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Rough]: Secondhand, eh? I'm afraid you got everything secondhand from this gentleman, Mrs Manningham. -- {Belittiling}\n[Rough]: For that is your immediate fate at the moment. (He puts down the brooch and moves to her) My dear Mrs Manningham - (he kisses her) my dear, dear Mrs Manningham! Don't you understand? -- {Invalidation, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No, what are you so excited about? -- {Dismissal, Not attempting to understand}\n[Rough]: (leaving her, and picking up the brooch) There you are, Mrs Manningham. The Barlow Rubies - complete. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! (He hands her the brooch and the rubies) Take a good look at them before they go to the Queen. -- {Exaggeration, Power games}\n[Rough]: Don't you see? Don't you see the whole thing? This is where the old lady hid her treasure at night - in a common trinket she wore all the day. I knew I had seen this somewhere before. And where was that? In portraits of the old lady - when I was on the case. She wore it on her breast. I remember it clearly though it was twenty years ago. Twenty years ago! Dear God in heaven, am I not a wonderful man? -- {Exaggeration, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: And I had it all the time. I had it all the time. -- {Exaggeration}\n[Rough]: Have the goodness to stop making a fool of yourself, Mrs Manningham. Here's your courage. (He gives her the bottle of whisky) Take some more of it, but don't get tipsy and don't leave it about. Goodbye. (He moves to the door) -- {Dismissal, Diminishing, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Inspector. -- {Impatience}\n[Rough]: Yes. -- {Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (summoning courage) All right... Goodbye. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Goodbye. (He goes out but turns back before completely closing the door) Mrs Manningham. -- {Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. -- {Indifference}\n[Rough]: All right... Goodbye. -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mr Manningham]: (putting the poker down, rising) Yes, Nancy, I did ring. It seems that the entire household has gone to bed, without leaving me my milk and without leaving me my biscuits. -- {Complaining, Accusation}\n[Nancy]: Oh, I'm sorry, sir. They're only just outside. I'll bring them in. Mrs Manningham usually gets them, doesn't she, sir? Cook's in bed, you see, and I've only just come in. -- {Feigning ignorance, Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: Quite, Nancy. Then perhaps you will deputize for Mrs Manningham, and bring them into the room. -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: And before you do that, Nancy, will you go upstairs and tell Mrs Manningham that I wish to see her down here. -- {Demanding, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - she still has a headache, has she? -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you ever know a time when Mrs Manningham did not have a headache, Nancy? -- {Dismissal, Belittiling}\n[Nancy]: No, sir. Hardly ever, sir. -- {Diminishing, Feigning ignorance}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you usually perform your domestic tasks in outdoor costume, Nancy? -- {Accusation, Judging}\n[Nancy]: I told you, sir. I've only just come in, and I heard the bell by chance. -- {Feigning ignorance, Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, that's just the point. -- {Dismissal, Indifference}\n[Nancy]: How do you mean, sir? -- {Not attempting to understand, Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you be so good as to come closer, Nancy, where I can see you. -- {Demanding, Power games}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Have you any idea of the time of the day, or rather night, Nancy? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - you thought you saw me. Well, I certainly saw you. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Have you ever reflected, Nancy, that you are given a great deal of latitude in this house? -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Latitude, Nancy, means considerable liberty - liberty to the extent of two nights off a week. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, that's all very well. It is not so well, however, when you return as late as the master of the house. We ought to keep up some pretences, you know. -- {Accusation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (in a more human tone) Where the devil have you been tonight, anyway? -- {Accusation, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, gentleman friends have been known to take decided liberties with young ladies like yourself. Are you alive to such a possibility? -- {Patronizing, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Nancy, pretty as your bonnet is, it is not anything near so pretty as your hair beneath it. Won't you take it off and let me see it? -- {Taking advantage}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Possibly. Come here, will you, Nancy? -- {Taking advantage}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Nancy, you are a very remarkable girl in many respects. I believe you are jealous of your mistress. -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why yes, Nancy, I believe it is. I think, however, don't you, that it would be better if you and I met one evening in different surroundings. -- {Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: And what of you, Nancy? Do you want me? -- {Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Really, Nancy, you have taken me a little by surprise. I'll let you know tomorrow. -- {Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, I'll find a way. -- {Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: All right, Nancy. Now you had better go. I have some work to do. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: There, run along. I have some work to do. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - I'm going to write some letters. Go along, Nancy, that's a good girl. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go upstairs and take a message for me to Mrs Manningham. -- {Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you please tell her that she is to come down here this instant, whether she is suffering from a sick headache or any other form of ailment. -- {Demanding, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mr Manningham]: Just like that, Nancy. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go to bed. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go to bed. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Good-night, Nancy. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: When I find time, Nancy, when I find time. Good-night. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Dog? What dog? -- {Feigning ignorance}\n[Mr Manningham]: Again? This is strange talk, Bella - from you - after what you did to the dog a few weeks ago. Come and sit down there. -- {Gaslighting, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: The dog, my dear Bella, was merely a ruse to compel you to pay me a visit quietly. Come and sit down where I told you. -- {Manipulation, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: (shouting) Come and sit down where I told you! -- {Aggression, Demanding}\n[Mr Manningham]: Quite a good deal Bella. Sit down and make yourself comfortable. We have plenty of time. -- {Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (calmly) Sit down and make yourself comfortable, Bella. We have plenty of time. -- {Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now you are not sitting in the chair I indicated, Bella. -- {Contempt, Excessive criticism}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. I thought I saw you, sir. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Did you, sir? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: I don't know, sir. I don't know what latitude means. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. We must. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Only with some friends, sir. -- {Evasion}\n[Nancy]: Oh, no, sir. Not with me. I can look after myself. -- {Defensiveness}\n[Nancy]: No, sir, not always, perhaps. -- {Evasion}\n[Nancy]: Very good, sir. It comes off easy enough. (She takes her bonnet off) There ... Is there anything more you want, sir? -- {Evasion}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir ... (She moves to him) Is there anything you want, sir ...? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: (Her tone changing) What do you want? Eh? What do you want? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: There! Can she do that for you? Can she do that? -- {Provocation}\n[Nancy]: You know who I mean all right. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: She? She's a poor thing. There's no need to be jealous of her. You want to kiss me again, don't you. Don't you want to kiss me? -- {Provocation, Belittling}\n[Nancy]: There! That's better than a sick headache - ain't it? - a sick headache and a pale face all the day. -- {Provocation, Belittling}\n[Nancy]: Yes. Where? I'll meet you when you like. You're mine now - ain't you? - 'cos you want me. You want me - don't you? -- {Manipulation}\n[Nancy]: Oh, yes! I always wanted you, ever since I first clapped eyes on you. I wanted you more than all of them. -- {Manipulation}\n[Nancy]: Oh, yes - there's plenty of others. -- {Manipulation}\n[Nancy]: Where can we meet? Where do you want us to meet? -- {Manipulation}\n[Nancy]: How'll you let me know, when she's about? -- {Manipulation}\n[Nancy]: Not that I care for her. I'd like to kiss you under her very nose. That's what I'd like to do. -- {Manipulation, Provocation}\n[Nancy]: Go? I don't want to go. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Work? What are you going to work at? What are you going to do? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Oh, very well, sir. You shall be master for a little more. (She kisses him) Good-night, your lordship. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: (moving to the door) When shall you let me know tomorrow? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. What is it now? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. What do you want me to say? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Just like that, sir? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: With the greatest of pleasure, sir. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: She won't come. She doesn't mean to come. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: She said she can't come - she's not well enough. She's just shamming, if you ask me. -- {Accusation, Judging}\n[Nancy]: The door's locked. She's got it locked. I tried it. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: She won't let you in. I can tell by her voice. She's got it locked and she won't open it. Are you going to batter it in? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. I'll do that. What are you going to write? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Yes? What? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: The dog? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: What's the game? What's the idea with the dog? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: All right. (She moves to the door) -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: (after a pause; taking the letter) What's the idea? What have you written in this? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: You're arum beggar, ain't you? (She moves to the door) Can't I look? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: She's coming. It's done the trick all right. -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Go on. What's the game? What's the row about? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: (comingforward to him) All right, I'm going. (She kisses him) Good night, old dear. Give her what-for, won't you? -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Ta-ta. (She heads for the door) -- {Ignoring}\n[Nancy]: Perhaps you will let me pass, madam. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Where is the dog? Where have you got the dog? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You said you had the dog. Have you hurt it? Let me have it. Where is it? Have you hurt it again? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I do not want to speak to you. I am not well. I thought you had the dog and were going to hurt it. That is why I came down. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. I want to go. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... Yes ... What do you want? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to go. You cannot keep me here. I want to go. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (going to a chair other than the one indicated and which is nearer the door) Say what you have to say. -- {Ignoring}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: I have to say that you are not sitting in the chair I indicated. Are you afraid of me that you desire to get so near the door? -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed. Then you have a good deal of courage, my dear. However, will you now sit down where I told you? -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you know what you remind me of, Bella, as you walk across the room? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Haven't you? Not that funny, glazed, dazed look of the wandering mind - the body that acts without the soul to guide it? I have often thought you had that look, but it's never been so strong as tonight. -- {Provocation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then may I ask why you are still fully dressed? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then will you tell me why, since you had gone to bed. you are still fully dressed? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: You don't know? Do you know anything about anything you do? -- {Provocation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You forgot to undress. A curious oversight, if I may say so, Bella. You know, you give me the appearance of having had a rather exciting time since I last saw you. Almost as though you have been up to something. Have you been up to something? -- {Provocation, Accusations based on assumptions}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you find that bill I told you to find? -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Am I married to a dumb woman, Bella, in addition to all else? The array of your physical and mental deficiencies is growing almost overwhelming. I advise you to answer me. -- {Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: It is not necessary for you to tell me that, Bella. I am just wondering if it might interrupt its gyratory motion for a fraction of a second, and concentrate upon the present conversation. Now please, what was it I a moment ago asked you if you remembered? -- {Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Admirable, my dear Bella! Admirable! We shall make a great logician of you yet - a Socrates - a John Stuart Mill! You shall go down to history as the shining mind of your day. That is, if your present history does not altogether submerge you - take you away from your fellow creatures. And there is a danger of that, you know, in more ways than one. Well - what did I say I would do if you did not find that bill? -- {Sarcasm, Patronizing, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. And do you believe me to be a man of my word? -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: You see, Bella, in a life of considerable and varied experience I have hammered out a few principles of action. In fact I actually fancy I know how to deal with my fellow men. I learned it quite early, actually - at school, in fact. There, you know, there were two ways of getting at what you wanted. One was along an intellectual plane, the other along the physical. If one failed one used the other. I took that lesson into life with me. Hitherto, with you, I have worked, with what forbearance and patience I leave you to judge, along the intellectual plane. The time has come now, I believe, to work along the other as well ... You will understand that I am a man of some power ... -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why do you look at me, Bella? I said I am a man of some power and determination, and as fully capable in one direction as in the other... I will leave your imagination to work on what I mean... However, we are really digressing ... You did not find the bill I told you to find. -- {Power games, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you look for it? (He moves towards the bureau) -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Around the room. Where around the room? (Pause) In my desk, for instance? -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you imagine you can lie to me? -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, listen to me. Your dark, confused, rambling mind has led you into playing some pretty tricks tonight - has it not? -- {Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Your mind is indeed tired. Your mind is so tired that it cannolongerworkatall. You do notthink. You dream. Dream all day long. Dream everything. Dream maliciously and incessantly. Don't you know that by now? You sleep-walking imbecile, what have you been dreaming tonight - where has your mind wandered - that you have split open my desk? What strange diseased dream have you had tonight - eh? -- {Belittiling, Making others feel insecure, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: All that happened when, Bella? Tonight? Of course you dreamed all that happened - or rather all that didn't happen. -- {Gaslighting, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: Have I not told you ? -- {Invalidating, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: (simultaneously) Sit down and be quiet. Sit down! -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: (more quietly and inquisitively) What was this dream of yours, Bella? You interest me. -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: I know you dreamed it, you gibbering wretch! I want to know more about this man of whom you dreamed. Do you hear! Do you hear me! -- {Belittiling, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: (after a pause) May I ask who the devil you are, and how you got in? -- {Hostility}\n[Mr Manningham]: And would you be kind enough to tell me what you are doing here? -- {Hostility}\n[Mr Manningham]: Don't you think you had better explain your business, sir? -- {Hostility}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella. Go to your room. -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: I shall find out the meaning of this, and deal with you in due course. -- {Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go to your room. I will call you down later. I have not finished with you yet, madam. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Done what? -- {Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you going to explain your business, sir, or am I going to fetch a policeman and have you turned out? -- {Threats, Hostility}\n[Mr Manningham]: (after a pause) You give me the impression, sir, that you have something up your sleeve. Will you go on with what you were saying? -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: What impression? -- {Feigning ignorance}\n[Rough]: Well, who I am seems a little doubtful. Apparently I am a mere figment of Mrs Manningham's imagination. As for how I got in: I came in, or rather I came back - or better still, I effected an entrance a few minutes before you, and I have been hidden away ever since. -- {Gaslighting}\n[Rough]: Waiting for some friends, Mr Manningham. waiting for some friends. Don't you think you had better go up to bed, Mrs Manningham? You look very tired. -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Rough]: Well, as a mere figment, as a mere ghost existing only in your wife's mind, I can hardly be said to have any business. Tell me, Mr Manningham, can you see me? No doubt your wife can, but it must be difficult for you. Perhaps if she goes to her room I will vanish, and you won't be bothered by me any more. -- {Gaslighting}\n[Rough]: I have no name, Manningham, in my present capacity. I am, as I have pointed out, a mere spirit. Perhaps a spirit of something you have evaded all your life - but in any case, only a spirit. Will you have a cigar with a spirit? We may have to wait some time. -- {Gaslighting}\n[Rough]: (lighting a cigar) Ah - an admirable idea. I could have thought of nothing better myself. Yes, fetch a policeman, Manningham, and have me turned out... (Pause) Why do you wait? -- {Provocation}\n[Rough]: (standing and facing Mr Manningham) Yes. But why not fetch a policeman? -- {Provocation}\n[Rough]: Yes, certainly. Where was I? Yes. (He pauses) Excuse me, Mr Manningham, but do you get the same impression as myself? -- {Gaslighting}\n\n\n[Rough]: Eerie, isn't it? Now we are almost in the dark... Why do you think that has happened? You don't suppose a light has been put on somewhere else ... You don't suppose that strangers have entered the house? You don't supposethereare other spirits - fellow spirits of mine - spirits surrounding this house now - spirits of justice, even, which have caught up with you at last, Mr Manningham? -- {Provocation, Accusation, Dramatization}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you off your head, sir? -- {Dismissal, Belittiling}\n[Rough]: No, sir. Just an old man seeing ghosts. It must be the atmosphere of this house. (Walking about) I can see them everywhere. It's the oddest thing. Do you know one ghost I can see, Mr Manningham? You could hardly believe it. -- {Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: Why, it's the ghost of an old woman, sir - the ghost of an old woman twenty years ago - an old woman who once lived in this house, who once lived in this very room. Yes - in this very room. What things I imagine! -- {Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: Remarkably clear, sir, I see it... An old woman getting ready to go to bed - here in this very room - an old woman getting ready to go up to bed at the end of the day. Why! There she is. She sits just there. And now it seems I see another ghost as well. -- {Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: (Looking at Mr Manningham) I see the ghost of a young man, Mr Manningham - a handsome, tall, well-groomed young man. But this young man has murder in his eyes. Why, God bless my soul, he might be you, Mr Manningham - he might be you! The old woman sees him. Don' t you see it all? She screams - screams for help - screams before her throat is cut - cut open with a knife. She lies dead on the floor - the floor of this room of this house. There! (Pause) Now I don't see that ghost any more. -- {Provocation, Accusation, Dramatization}\n[Mr Manningham]: What's the game - eh? What's the game? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (confronting Manningham) But I still see the ghost of the man. I see him, all through the night, as he ransacks the house, hour after hour, room after room, ripping everything up. turning everything out, madly seeking the thing he cannot find. Then twenty years pass, and where is he? Why, sir, is he not still in the same house, the house he ransacked, the house he searched - and does he not now stand before the ghost of the woman he killed, in the room in which he killed her? A methodical man, apatient man, but perhaps he has waited too long. For justice has waited too, and here she is, in my person, to exact her due. And justice found, my friend, in one hour what you sought for twenty years, and still could not find. See here. Look what she found. (He moves to the bureau and picks up the bill, the letter and the brooch as he mentions them) First a bill which your wife had lost. Then a letter which never reached your wife. Then a brooch which you gave your wife but which she lost. How wicked of her! But then she didn't know its value. How was she to know that it held the Barlow Rubies. There (He opens out the brooch) See. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! There you are, sir! You killed one woman for those and tried to drive another out of her mind. And all the time they lay in your own desk, and all they have brought you is a rope around your neck! Well, the game is over, Sydney Power, and I advise you to take the matter philosophically. -- {Accusation, Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Mr Manningham]: You seem, sir, to have some very remarkable information. Do you imagine you are going to leave this room with such information in your possession? (He moves to the door as though to lock it) -- {Dismissal, Threats}\n[Rough]: Do you imagine, sir, that you are going to leave this room without suitable escort? -- {Provocation, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: May I ask what you mean by that? -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Only that I have men in the house already. Didn't you realize that they had signalled their arrival from above, your own way in, Mr Manningham, when the light went down? -- {Provocation, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Here you... What the devil's this? (He rushes to the door and opens it) -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: (going up to Mr Manningham) Sydney Charles Power, I have a warrant for your arrest for the murder of Alice Barlow. I should warn you that anything you may say now may be taken down in writing and used as evidence at a later date. Will you accompany us to the station in a peaceful manner? You will oblige us all, and serve your own interests best, Power, by coming with us quietly ... -- {Accusation, Threats}\n[Rough]: Very well - take him away ... -- {Dismissal, Threats}\n[Rough]: Now, my dear, come and sit down. Well, my child, there's all your life ahead now. It's Devonshire cream for you, and the sparkle back in your eyes. But you've had a bad time. I came in from nowhere and gave you the most horrible evening of your life, didn't I? The most horrible evening of anybody's life, I should imagine. -- {Dismissal, Belittiling}\n[Mrs Manningham]: The most horrible ... Oh, no ... (With a sort of proud defiance) The most wonderful... Far and away the most wonderful. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: What are you doing, Bella? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: (closing his eyes again) What are you doing, Bella? Come here ... -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now then, Bella. We've had this out before. Be so good as to ring the bell. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (stopping her with an outstretched hand) No, no, no, no, no ... Where's the girl? Let the girl come up if Lizzie's out. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go and ring the bell, please, Bella - there's a good child. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: What do you suppose the servants are for, Bella? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go on. Answer me. What do you suppose servants are for? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Consider them? There's your extraordinary confusion of the mind again. You speak as though they work for no consideration. I happen to consider Elizabeth to the tune of sixteen pounds per annum. And the girl ten. Twenty-six pounds a year all told. And if that is not consideration of the most acute and lively kind, I should like to know what is. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have no doubt of it, my dear. It's sheer weak mindedness to think otherwise. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: You're looking very impudent and pretty this afternoon, Nancy. Do you know that? -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: But, my dear, you're the mistress of the house. It was your business to tell her to put the coal on. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: But you seem to look upon the servants as our natural equals. So I treated her as one. (He picks up his paper and sits down on the settee) Besides, I was only trifling with her. -- {Dismissal, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: But, my dear- if she does that, doesn't the fault lie with you? -- {Dismissal, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't mean anything. It's you who read meanings into everything, Bella dear. I wish you weren't such a perfect little silly. Come here and stop it. I've just thought of something rather nice. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: I shan't tell you unless you come here. -- {Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: I not only would take you to see MacNaughton, my dear. I am going to take you to see MacNaughton. That is, if you want to go. -- {Manipulation}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, my dear, you've been very good lately, and I thought it would be well to take you out of yourself. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, Jack dear. You have been so much kinder lately. Is it possible you're beginning to see my point of view? -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't know that I ever differed from it, did I, Bella? -- {Gaslighting, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You know ... You know in what way, dear. About - all that's happened lately. We said we wouldn't speak about it. -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, no - don't let's speak about that. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: I wonder if it is that - or whether it's merely that your medicine is beginning to benefit you? -- {Diminishing, Dismissing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No, Jack, dear, it's not my medicine. I've taken my medicine religiously - haven't I taken it religiously? Much as I detest it! It's more than medicine that I want. It's the medicine of a sweet, sane mind, of being interested in something. Don't you see what I mean? -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well - we are talking about gloomy subjects, aren't we? -- {Changing the topic, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, dear. Don't I seem to? Haven't I just said I'm taking you to the theatre? -- {Patronizing, Dismissing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I think you imagine things, my dear. -- {Gaslighting, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: My dear - what are you doing? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: You seem wonderfully pleased with yourself, Bella. I must take you to the theatre more often, if this is the result. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (suddenly rising, looking at the wall opposite him; in a calm, yet menacing voice) I don't know, I'm sure ... I don't know ... -- {Threats, Intimidation}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know perfectly well what has happened, Bella, and if you will rectify it at once I will say no more about it. -- {Gaslighting, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you trying to make a fool of me, Bella? What I refer to is on the wall behind you. If you will put it back, I will forget the matter. -- {Gaslighting, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Why has it been taken down? Why, indeed? You alone can answer that, Bella. Why was it taken down before? Will you please take it from wherever you have hidden it, and put it back on the wall again. -- {Accusation, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: Someone else? Are you suggesting that I should play such a fantastic and wicked trick? -- {Gaslighting, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Someone else, eh? Someone else. (Shaking her off ) Will you leave go of me. You repel me - you half-witted thing. (He walks over to the bell-cord) We will see about \"someone else\". -- {Gaslighting, Accusation, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: (shaking her off violently) Will you leave go of me and sit down there! (He moves to the fireplace) Someone else - eh? Well - we shall see. -- {Aggression, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: You had better pull yourself together, hadn't you ... ? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah, Elizabeth, do you notice anything amiss in this room? Look carefully around the walls, and see if you notice anything amiss ... Well, Elizabeth, what do you notice? -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Exactly. The picture has been taken down. You noticed it at once. Now was that picture in its place when you dusted the room this morning? -- {Diminishing, Not caring}\n[Elizabeth]: Yes, sir. It was, sir. I don't understand, sir. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Neither do I, Elizabeth, neither do I. And now, before you go, just one question. Was it you who removed that picture, Elizabeth? -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed, why should you? And now please, will you kiss that Bible, which lies on that desk there, as a token of your truthfulness... -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving to Mr Manningham) Jack - spare me that girl. Don't call her in. I'll say anything. I'll say that I did it. I did it, Jack, I did it. Don't have that girl in. Don't! -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you have the goodness to contain yourself? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, I do want you, Nancy ... If you will look at the wall on your left, you will see that the picture has gone. -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: I did not ask for any comment on your part, Nancy. Kindly be less insolent and answer what I ask you. Did you take that picture down, or did you not? -- {Dismissal, Accusation, Not offering constructive solutions}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then, by God, you are mad, and you don't know what you do. You unhappy wretch - you're stark gibbering mad - like your wretched mother before you. -- {Accusation, Belittiling, Attacking}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack - you promised you would never say that again. -- {Dismissal, Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (after a pause) The time has come to face facts, Bella. If this progresses you will not be much longer under my protection. -- {Threats, Power games, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack - I'm going to make a last appeal to you. I'm going to make a last appeal. I'm desperate, Jack. Can' t you see that I'm desperate? If you can't, you must have a heart of stone. -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella, my dear - have you any idea where that picture is now? -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then you did know where it was, Bella. You did know where it was. -- {Accusation, Gaslighting}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No! No! I only supposed it was! I only supposed it was because it was found there before! It was found there twice before. Don't you see? I didn 't know - I didn' t! -- {Denying, Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: There is no sense in walking about the room with a picture in your hand, Bella. Go and put it back in its proper place. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, Bella, I said a moment ago that we have got to face facts. And that is what we have got to do. I am not going to say anything at the moment for my feelings are running too high. In fact, I am going out immediately, and I suggest that you go to your room and lie down for a little in the dark. -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving DS of the table) No, no - not my room. For God's sake don't send me to my room! -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: There is no question of sending you to your room, Bella. You know perfectly well that you may do exactly as you please. Everything - - -- {Gaslighting, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I feel faint, Jack ... I feel faint... -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, my dear, I am going to leave you in peace ... -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (reclining, her eyes closed) Have you got to go? Must you go? Must you always leave me alone after these dreadful scenes? -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, no argument, please. I had to go in any case after tea, and I am merely leaving a little earlier, that's all. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Very good ... (He moves to the door, and stops) Oh, by the way, I shall be passing the grocer and I might as well pay that bill of his and get it done with. Where is it, my dear? I gave it to you, didn't I? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: No, dear - don't move - don't move. I can find it. (He moves to the bureau and rummages through it) I shall be glad to get the thing off my chest. Where is it, dear? Is it in on of these drawers? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (soothingly) All right, dear. Don't worry. Lie down. It's of no importance. We'll find it... No, it's not here ... It must be in one of the drawers ... -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It's not in one of the drawers! I put it out here on top! -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (simultaneously) My dear. Calm yourself. Calm yourself. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You're not going to tell me this has gone, are you? -- {Accusation, Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (walking away L) My God! What new trick is this you're playing upon me? -- {Accusation, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It was there this afternoon! I put it there! This is a plot! This is a filthy plot! You're all against me! It's a plot! (She screams hysterically) -- {Accusation, Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: (coming to her and shaking her violently) Will you control yourself! Will you control yourself! Listen to me, madam, if you utter another sound I'll knock you down and take you to your room and lock you in darkness for a week. I have been too lenient with you, and I mean to alter my tactics. -- {Threats, Power games, Attacking}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (sinking to her knees) Oh, God help me! God help me! -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: May God help you, indeed. Now listen to me. I am going to leave you until ten o'clock. In that time you will recover that paper, and admit to me that you have lyingly and purposely concealed it... If not, you will take the consequences. You are going to see a doctor, madam, more than one doctor - and they shall decide what this means. Now do you understand me? -- {Threats, Power games, Accusation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, God - be patient with me. If I am mad, be patient with me. -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: (moving to the door) I have been patient with you and controlled myself long enough. It is no w for you to control yourself, or take the consequences. Think upon that, Bella. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack... Jack... Don't go ... Jack ... You're still going to take me to the theatre, aren't you? -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: What a question to ask me at such a time. No, madam, emphatically I am not. You play fair by me, and I'll play fair by you. If we are going to be enemies, you and I, you will find that it is I who shall get the best of it. -- {Dismissal, Power games, Threats}\n[Mrs Manningham, whimpering, moves to the bureau and searches in the drawers, breaking down into sobs. She searches elsewhere in the room, holding her head and crying. At last she breaks down into sobbing upon the settee. Pause. She rises, goes to the little table, and takes some medicine. This is obviously incredibly nasty, and almost chokes her. She staggers. She goes over to the lamp and turns it down very low. She then moves back to the settee] -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes!... Yes!... What is it. Elizabeth? Leave me alone. -- {Diminishing, Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: Madam, there's somebody called. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Who is it? I don't want to be disturbed. -- {Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: It's a gentleman, madam - he wants to see you. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Tell him to go. Elizabeth. He wants to see my husband. My husband's out. -- {Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: No, madam - he wants to see you. You must see him, madam. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, leave me alone. Tell him to go away. I want to be left alone. -- {Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: Madam, madam. I don't know what's going on between you and the master, but you've got to hold up, madam. You've got to hold up. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I am going out of my mind, Elizabeth. That's what's going on. -- {Exaggeration}\n[Elizabeth]: Don't talk like that, madam. You've got to be brave. You mustn't go on lying here in the dark, or your mind will go. You must see this gentleman. It's you he wants - not the master. He's waiting below. Come, madam, it'll take you out of yourself. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal, Invalidation}\n[Rough]: Thank you... Ah - good evening. (He moves to Mrs Manningham) Mrs Manningham, I believe ... How are you, Mrs Manningham? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (shaking hands with Rough but not letting go of his hand) How do you do. I'm very much afraid ... -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: You're very much afraid you don't know me from Adam? That's about the root of the matter, isn't it? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, no - it's not that - but no doubt you have come to see my husband? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: (still holding her hand and looking at her appraisingly) Oh. no! You couldn't be further out. On the contrary, I have chosen this precise moment to call when I knew your husband was out. May I take off my things and sit down? -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: You're a good deal younger and more attractive than I thought, you know. But you're looking very pale. Have you been crying? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Really - I'm afraid I don't understand at all. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: You will do so, madam, very shortly. (He moves L and removes his scarf during the following) You're the lady who's going off her head, aren't you? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving towards him) What made you say that? Who are you? What have you come to talk about? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: (taking off his coat and putting it on a chair) Well, of one thing you can be certain. I have not come to talk about the weather. Though that indeed merits a world of comment at the moment. But you're running away with things, Mrs Manningham, and asking me a good deal I can't answer at once. Instead of that, I am going to ask you a question or two ... Now, please, will you come here and give me your hands? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Now, Mrs Manningham, I want you to take a good look at me, and see if you are not looking at someone to whom you can give your trust. I am a perfect stranger to you, and you can read little in my face besides that. But I can read a great deal in yours. -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Rough]: Why, madam. I can read the tokens of one who has travelled a very long way upon the path of sorrow and doubt - and will have, I fear, to travel a little further before she comes to the end. But I fancy she is coming towards the end, for all that. Come now. are you going to trust me, and listen to me? I'm old enough to be your grandfather. -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Who are you? God knows I need help. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: I very much doubt whether God knows anything of the sort, Mrs Manningham. Had he done so I believe he would have come to your aid before this. But I am here, and so you must give me your faith. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Nothing so learned, ma'am. Just a plain police detective. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Police detective? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Yes. Or was ten years ago. At any rate, still detective enough to see that you've been interrupted in your tea. Couldn't you start again, and let me have a cup? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: (fetching a chair and bringing it to the table) You never heard of the celebrated Sergeant Rough, madam? Sergeant Rough, who solved the Claudesley Diamond Case - Sergeant Rough, who hunted down the Camberwell Dogs - Sergeant Rough, who brought Sandham himself to justice ... (He puts his hand on the back of the chair, and looks at her) Or were all such sensations before your time? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Sandham? Why, yes, I have heard of Sandham - the murderer, the throttler. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Yes, madam, Sandham the Throttler. And you are now looking at the man who gave Sandham to the man who throttled him. And that was the common hangman. In fact, Mrs Manningham, you have in front of you one who was quite a personage in his day - believe it or not. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I quite believe it. Won't you sit down? I'm afraid it won' t be very hot. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Thank you... How long have you been married, Mrs Manningham? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Seven years - and a little. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Where have you lived during all that time, Mrs Manningham? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (putting milk in Rough's cup and passing it to him) Why ... First we went abroad - then we lived in Yorkshire, and then six months ago my husband took this house. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: (taking the cup) Thank you ... And does your husband always leave you alone like this in the evenings? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. He goes to his club, I believe, and does business. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: (stirring his tea; thoughtfully) So you believe. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: And does your husband give you a free run of the whole house while he's out? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... Well, no... Not the top floor. Why do you ask? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Ah - not the top floor ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No... no... Will you have some sugar? What were you saying? (She sits, bending over eagerly to answer his questions) -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Before I go any further, Mrs Manningham, I must tell you there's a leakage in this household. You have a maid called Nancy? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... Yes... -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: And Nancy walks out of an evening with a young man named Booker in my employ. I only live a few streets away from you, you know. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, yes? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Well, there is hardly anything which goes on in this house which is not described in detail to Booker, and from that quarter it reaches me. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I knew it! I knew she talked. Now I know it, she shall be dismissed. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Oh, no - no such retribution is going to overtake her at the moment, Mrs Manningham. In fact, I fancy you are going to be heavily in debt to your maid, Nancy. If it were not for her indiscretions I should not be here now, should I? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What do you mean? What is this mystery? You must not keep me in the dark. What is it? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: I'm afraid I shall have to keep you in the dark for a little, Mrs Manningham, as I am still quite far down in the dark myself. Can I have another lump of sugar in this? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Thank you. We were talking about the top floor. (Helping himself to several lumps) There is a bedroom above this, and above that again is the top floor? Is that right? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Now - have you ever been up to that top floor? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. Never ... It's shut up. My husband has forbidden it. No-one goes up there. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Not even a servant to dust. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Rather funny? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Yes. (Pause) Yes, indeed ... -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Yes. Now, Mrs Manningham, to ask a personal question: when did you first get the notion into your head that your reason was playing you tricks? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) How did you know? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Never mind how I know. How did it begin? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I always had that dread. My mother died insane, when she was quite young. When she was my age. But only in the last six months, in this house - things began to happen - - -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Which are driving you mad with fear? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. Which are driving me mad with fear. -- {Exaggeration}\n[Rough]: Is it the house itself you fear, Mrs Manningham? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. I suppose it is. I hate the house. I always did. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: And has the top floor got anything to do with it? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, yes, it has. How did you know? That's how all this dreadful horror began. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Ah - now you interest me beyond measure. Do tell me about the top floor. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I don't know what to say. It all sounds incredible... It's when I'm alone at night. I get the idea that - somebody's walking about up there ... (Shepoints up) Up there ... At night, when my husband's out - I hear noises, from my bedroom, but I'm too afraid to go up ... -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Have you told your husband about this? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. I'm afraid to. He gets angry. He says I imagine things which don't exist. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: It never struck you, did it, that it might be your own husband walking about up there? -- {Ignoring}\n\n[Rough]: Why not tell me first how you knew, Mrs Manningham. -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: That's what we're going to find out, Mrs Manningham. But there are such commonplace resources as roofs and fire escapes, you know. Now please don't look so frightened. Your husband is no ghost, believe me, and you are very far from mad. Tell me now, what made you first think it was him? -- {Diminishing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Now try to keep calm. You can tell me just as well sitting down, can't you? Won't you sit down? -- {Patronizing}\n[Rough]: How very strange, indeed. You know. Mrs Manningham, you should have been a policeman. -- {Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Oh no! I was merely praising the keenness of your observation. I not only think you are right in your suppositions, I think you have made a very remarkable discovery, and one which may have very far-reaching consequences. -- {Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Well, let's leave it for the moment. Tell me, that is not the only cause, is it, which has lately given you reason to doubt your sanity? Has anything else been happening? Don't be afraid to tell me. -- {Patronizing, Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: (putting his hands on hers) Do you know, Mrs Manningham, it has occurred to me that you'd be all the better for a little medicine. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: No. I'm not a doctor, but that doesn't mean that a little medicine would do you any harm. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Ah - that we don'tknow.The fact remains that it does. Here we are. (He produces a bottle of whisky) You see, it comes from Scotland. Now, madam, have you such a thing handy as two glasses or two cups? -- {Dismissal, Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: You underestimate your powers, Mrs Manningham. You see, I don't want you thinking you can't trust your reason. This will give you faith in your reason like nothing else... Now for some water... All right, this will do. (He picks up the jug and pours water into Mrs Manningham's glass) There! (He hands the glass to her) Tell me - (pouring water into his own glass) did you ever hear of \"The Cabman's Friend\", Mrs Manningham? -- {Patronizing, Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: Ah. \"The Cabman's Friend\". (He moves to the mantelpiece) You should ask me who was \"The Cabman's Friend\", Mrs Manningham, for she was an old lady who died many, many years ago. (He puts his whisky on the mantelpiece) -- {Changing the topic, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Rough]: A great deal, I fancy, if you will follow me patiently. Her name was Barlow - Alice Barlow, and she was an old lady of great wealth, and decided eccentricities. In fact, her principal mania in life was the protection of cabmen. You may think that an extraordinary hobby, but in her odd way she did a lot of good. She provided these men with shelters, clothing, pensions, and so forth, and that was her little contribution to the sum of the world's happiness, or rather her little stand against the sum of the world's pain. There is a great deal of pain in this world, Mrs Manningham, you know. Well, it was not my privilege to know her, but it was my duty, on just one occasion, to see her. That was when her throat was cut open, and she lay dead on the floor of her own house. -- {Changing the topic, Provocation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: Yes. She was murdered. I was only a comparatively young officer at the time, but it made an extremely horrible, in fact I may say lasting, impression on me. The murderer was never discovered but the motive was obvious enough. The Barlow Rubies had been inherited by her, and it was well known that she kept them, without any proper precautions, in her bedroom on an upper floor. She lived alone except for a deaf servant in the basement. Well, for that she paid the penalty of her life. -- {Provocation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: Well, it seemed to me, from all that I gathered here and there, that the old lady might have been an eccentric, but that she was by no means a fool. It seemed to me that she might have been one too clever for that man. We presume he killed her to silence her, but what then? What if she had not been so careless? What if she had got those jewels hidden away in some inconceivably cunning place, in the walls, floored down, bricked in, maybe? What if the only person who could tell him where they were was lying dead on the floor! Would not that account, Mrs Manningham, for all the strange confusion in which the place was found. Can't you picture him. Mrs Manningham, searching through the night, ransacking the place, hour after hour, growing more and more desperate, until at last the dawn comes and he has to slink out into the pale street, the blood and wreckage of the night behind. And the deaf servant down in the basement sleeping like a dog through it all. -- {Provocation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: No, Mrs Manningham, the man was never found. Nor has the Barlow jewellery ever come to light. -- {Provocation, Making others feel insecure}\n\n[Rough]: I think he is almost certainly alive today, but I don't believe he found what he wanted. That is, if my theory is right. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Rough]: Indeed, Mrs Manningham, if my theory is right, the jewels must still be where she hid them, but then, of course, it was only a theory and that formed in quite a young man, long enough ago. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Rough]: Ah, that is the whole question, Mrs Manningham. What, indeed? What has the obscure murder of an old lady twenty years ago to do with an attractive, though I am afraid at present somewhat pale and wan young lady in this house, who believes she is going out of her mind, and watches the gaslight going up and down when her husband is out at night? Well, I believe there is a link, however remote, wild and strange it may be, and that is why I am here. -- {Dismissal, Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: Do you conceive it possible, Mrs Manningham, that that man might not have given up hope of one day getting at the treasure which lay there, and have bided his time until he could somehow re-enter the house? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Can you conceive that he may have waited years - five years, ten years, fifteen years, twenty years even - time in which he may have done many things: gone abroad, got married even, until at last his chance came to resume the search begun on that terrible night? You don't follow where I am leading at all, do you, Mrs Manningham? -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: What's the matter, Mrs Manningham? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: How dark it is. You could hardly see to read. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) Quiet, Mrs Manningham, quiet! You have got to keep your head. Don't you see my meaning, yet? Don't you understand that this was the house? -- {Dismissal, Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: Precisely that, Mrs Manningham. Your husband. (He fetches the glass of whiskyfrom the mantelpiece) You see, I am afraid you are married to a tolerantly dangerous gentleman. Now drink this quickly, as we have a great deal to do. (He holds out the glass to her) -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure, Taking advantage}\n[Rough]: Why, ma'am, because I was on the case, and came here myself, that's all. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham ... -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Yes. Sydney Power. It conveys nothing to you? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Well, he was a kind of distant cousin apparently much attached to the old lady, and even assisting her in her good works. The only thing was that I remembered his face. Well. I saw that face again about five weeks ago. It took me a whole day to discover where I had seen it before, but I remembered it at last. -- {Dismissal, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: It was not so much my remembering Mr Sydney Power, Mrs Manningham. What startled me was the lady on his arm, and the locality in which I saw him. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: You were the lady on his arm, Mrs Manningham, and you were walking down this street. -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Well, not exactly, for if my theories are right - - -- {Dismissal, Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) No, Mrs Manningham, I am not cold, and I am not talking riddles. I am just trying to preserve a cold and calculating tone, because you are up against the most awful moment in your life, and your whole future depends on what you are going to do in the next hour. Nothing less. You have got to strike for your freedom, and strike now, for the moment may not come again. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure, Threats}\n[Rough]: You are not going out of your mind, Mrs Manningham, you are slowly, methodically, systematically being driven out of your mind. And why? Because you are married to a criminal maniac who is afraid you are beginning to know too much - a criminal maniac who steals back to his own house at night, still searching for something he could not find twenty years ago. Those are the facts, wild and incredible as they may seem. His name is no more Manningham than mine is. He is Sydney Power and he murdered Alice Barlow in this house. He changed his name, and he has waited all these years, until he found it safe to acquire this house in a legal way. He then acquired the empty house next door. Every night, for the last few weeks, he has entered that house from the back, climbed up on to its roof and come into this house by the skylight. I know that because I have seen him do it. You have watched the gaslight, and been aware of the same thing. He is up there now. Why he should employ this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting at what he wants, God himself only knows. For the same reason, perhaps, that he employs this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting rid of you: that is by slowly driving you mad and sending you into a lunatic asylum. Thank God you are not married to him, and that I have come here to save you from the workings of his wicked mind. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure, Threats, Gaslighting}\n[Rough]: I have no doubt he did, Mrs Manningham. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, he contracted the same sort of union with another lady many years before he met you. Moreover the lady is still alive, and the English law has a highly exacting taste in monogamy. You see, I have been finding things out about Mr Sydney Power. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure, Gaslighting}\n[Rough]: By which you mean, of course, the man who has betrayed you into thinking that you are married to him - don't you? -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure, Gaslighting}\n[Rough]: Indeed, cling to him by all means, but do not imagine you are the only piece of ivy. You can cling to him if you desire, as his fancy women cling to him in the low resorts of the town. That is the sort of wall you have to cling to, ma'am. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure, Gaslighting}\n[Rough]: I'm not suggesting anything. I am only telling you what I have seen. He comes to life at night, this gentleman upstairs, in more ways than one. I have made it my business to follow him on some of his less serious excursions, and I can promise you he has a taste in unemployed actresses which he is at no pains to conceal. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure, Gaslighting}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham, it is hard to take everything from you, but you are no more tied to this man. you are under no more obligation to him than those wretched women in those places. You must learn to be thankful for that. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure, Gaslighting}\n[Rough]: (completely changing his tone, striding up and down in a business like way) I want his papers, Mrs Manningham - his identity. There is some clue somewhere in this house, and we have got to get at it. Where does he keep his papers? -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n\n[Rough]: Oh - it doesn't look so formidable. (He fetches a ring of keys and implementsfrom his overcoat pocket during the following) You know, Mrs Manningham, one of the greatest regrets of my life is that fate never made me one of two things: one was a gardener, the other a burglar - both quiet occupations, Mrs Manningham. As for the last, if I'd started young, and worked my way up, I should have been a genius. Now let's have a look at this. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But you must not touch this. He will know what you have done. -- {Not caring}\n[Rough]: Come now, ma'am. You're working with me, aren't you - not against me? (He looks at the bureau) Yes ... Yes... Now do you mind if I take off my coat? I'm a man who never feels at work until his coat's off. (He takes off his jacket, revealing a pink fancy shirt) Quite a saucy shirt, don't you think? You didn 't suspect I was such a dandy, did you? Now. (He goes over to the bureau) Let's have a real look at this. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Not if we are clever enough. And this one here doesn't even ask for cleverness ... You see, Mrs Manningham, there are all manner of -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Do as I say, and ring the bell. At once, please. -- {Demanding}\n[Rough]: (putting on his overcoat) All in good time. He's not going to jump through the window, you know. In fact he can't be round at our front door in less than five minutes - unless he's a magician. Now can you see anything that I've missed? -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Are you anxious to help your mistress, blindly, without asking any questions? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Come now, Elizabeth. Are you or are you not? -- {Demanding}\n[Rough]: Would you be good enough to take me down to your kitchen and hide me away for a short space of time? You can put me in the oven if you like. -- {Manipulation, Taking advantage}\n[Rough]: (kindly taking her hand) Come now, Elizabeth. Are you or are you not? -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Rough]: Now where are you going to hide me, Elizabeth? Make up your mind quickly, as time is getting rather short. -- {Demanding, Creating a time pressure}\n[Rough]: That sounds altogether entrancing! Shall we go there now? -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: You think of everything, Elizabeth, and you're a good soul. (He moves to the door UR) Where does this lead to. and what's the matter with this? -- {Patronizing}\n[Rough]: (going again to the window and looking out briefly) Excuse me. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Perfect accommodation. (He goes to the window for another peep. He sees something) Yes, there he is. Now we really have got to hurry. Get off to bed, Mrs Manningham, quick. And you, Elizabeth, go to your room. You can't get downstairs in time. Hurry, please. Elizabeth, turn down that lamp. (He turns down the gaslights during the following) -- {Ignoring, Dismissal, Demanding}\n[Rough]: (really excited for the first time) Yes, quick. He's coming. Don't you understand. Go there and stay there. Take her, Elizabeth. You have a bad headache - a bad headache. (Turning from the gaslight; quite angrily) Will you take her, in heaven's name! -- {Demanding, Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then we must be quiet, mustn't we? Walk about like cats ... Can you walk about like a cat, Elizabeth? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I think you had better clear away the tea things, Elizabeth. -- {Demanding}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, yes. I am going to have supper. The question is, am I going to have supper here? -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why, do you know where my collars are kept? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: What a lot you know, Elizabeth. And do you know the sort of collar I want tonight? -- {Patronizing}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Then all I can say is you know a great deal more than I do ... No ... I think you must let me choose my own collar ... (He moves towards the door R and stops) That is, if I have your permission, Elizabeth. -- {Diminishing, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: What did you think about Mrs Manningham tonight, Elizabeth? -- {Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. I doubt if you guess to what extent she is unwell. Or are you beginning to guess? -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: I'm afraid I was compelled to drag you and Nancy into our troubles tonight. Perhaps I should not have done that. -- {Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Mr Manningham]: I'm at my wits' end, Elizabeth. Don't you know that? -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have tried everything. Kindness, patience, cunning - even harshness, to bring her to her senses. But nothing will stop these wild, wild hallucinations, nothing will stop these wicked pranks and tricks. -- {Exaggeration, Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: You don't know a quarter of it, Elizabeth. You only see what is forced upon your attention - as it was tonight. You have no conception of what goes on all the time. -- {Invalidation, Diminishing}\n[Mr Manningham]: She died in the mad-house, Elizabeth, without any brain at all in the end. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, don't you, that I shall have to bring a doctor to Mrs Manningham before long, Elizabeth? I have fought against it to the last, but it can't be kept a secret much longer. -- {Manipulation, Fear-Then-Relief Procedure}\n[Mr Manningham]: I mean to say, you know what goes on. You can testify to what goes on, can't you? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed, you may have to testify in the end. Do you realize that? -- {Manipulation, Fear-Then-Relief Procedure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You're a very good soul. I sometimes wonder how you put up with things in this household - this dark household. I wonder why you do not go. You're very loyal. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: There now, how touching. I thank you, Elizabeth. You will be repaid later for what you have said, and repaid in more ways than one. You understand that, don't you? -- {Manipulation, Promise of future reward}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, I know that. Well, Elizabeth, I am going out. In fact, I' m even going to try and be a little gay. Can you understand that, or do you think it is wrong? -- {Manipulation, Victim playing}\n[Rough]: He was right when he said you would be repaid, Elizabeth. Though not in the way he thinks. -- {Manipulation, Promise of future reward}\n[Rough]: If you will be brave now, you will not have to wait so long. Are you going to be brave? -- {Manipulation, Promise of future reward}\n[Rough]: I have no idea what you will say when he comes back, Mrs Manningham. But then I have no idea what you will do when he comes back, Mrs Manningham, if I have no evidence to remove you from his loving care for good. -- {Manipulation, Fear-Then-Relief Procedure}\n\n[Rough]: There is only one thing we can do - go ahead. If we go back now, we are lost. I am going to force it and gamble on finding something. Are you with me? -- {Creating a constraint favorable to the speaker, Creating artificial obligations}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But don't you see... All right. Force it. Force it. But be quick. -- {Feigning ignorance}\n[Rough]: (working on the lock) There's no hurry, ma'am. He's quite happy where he is... Now I don't like - (straining at the lock) violent methods - of this sort - it makes me feel like a dentist... There ... -- {Diminishing, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Nothing at present, I' m afraid... Nothing at present... Wait a minute ... No ... No ... (Looking at a document) What's this? -- {Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Rough]: (looking more closely) One moment... No ... Not a thing. We have lost our gamble, ma'am, I'm afraid. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Some rapid thinking at the moment. Don't have any fear, Mrs Manningham, I've been in many a tighter corner than this. Let's get these things back to begin with, shall we? Give me the watch and the brooch. We must put them back where they were. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Rough]: Secondhand, eh? I'm afraid you got everything secondhand from this gentleman, Mrs Manningham. -- {Belittiling}\n[Rough]: For that is your immediate fate at the moment. (He puts down the brooch and moves to her) My dear Mrs Manningham - (he kisses her) my dear, dear Mrs Manningham! Don't you understand? -- {Ignoring boundaries, Power games}\n[Rough]: (leaving her, and picking up the brooch) There you are, Mrs Manningham. The Barlow Rubies - complete. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! (He hands her the brooch and the rubies) Take a good look at them before they go to the Queen. -- {Power games}\n[Rough]: I am going to mo ve heaven and earth, Mrs Manningham, and if I have any luck I shall be back tonight. -- {Exaggeration}\n[Rough]: Have the goodness to stop making a fool of yourself, Mrs Manningham. Here's your courage. (He gives her the bottle of whisky) Take some more of it, but don't get tipsy and don't leave it about. Goodbye. -- {Dismissal, Belittiling}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, Nancy, I did ring. It seems that the entire household has gone to bed, without leaving me my milk and without leaving me my biscuits. -- {Complaining}\n[Mr Manningham]: And before you do that, Nancy, will you go upstairs and tell Mrs Manningham that I wish to see her down here. -- {Demanding}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you ever know a time when Mrs Manningham did not have a headache, Nancy? -- {Sarcasm}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you usually perform your domestic tasks in outdoor costume, Nancy? -- {Ridiculing, Belittiling}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you be so good as to come closer, Nancy, where I can see you. -- {Demanding}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Have you any idea of the time of the day, or rather night, Nancy? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - you thought you saw me. Well, I certainly saw you. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Have you ever reflected, Nancy, that you are given a great deal of latitude in this house? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Latitude, Nancy, means considerable liberty - liberty to the extent of two nights off a week. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, that's all very well. It is not so well, however, when you return as late as the master of the house. We ought to keep up some pretences, you know. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (in a more human tone) Where the devil have you been tonight, anyway? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, gentleman friends have been known to take decided liberties with young ladies like yourself. Are you alive to such a possibility? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you always so anxious to look after yourself? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Nancy, pretty as your bonnet is, it is not anything near so pretty as your hair beneath it. Won't you take it off and let me see it? -- {Taking advantage, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Possibly. Come here, will you, Nancy? -- {Taking advantage, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mr Manningham]: Who can you be talking about, Nancy? -- {Evasion, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Nancy, you are a very remarkable girl in many respects. I believe you are jealous of your mistress. -- {Patronizing, Accusation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why yes, Nancy, I believe it is. I think, however, don't you, that it would be better if you and I met one evening in different surroundings. -- {Taking advantage, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mr Manningham]: And what of you, Nancy? Do you want me? -- {Taking advantage}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - there are plenty of others? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Really, Nancy, you have taken me a little by surprise. I'll let you know tomorrow. -- {Evasion, Procrastination}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, I'll find a way. -- {Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: All right, Nancy. Now you had better go. I have some work to do. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: There, run along. I have some work to do. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - I'm going to write some letters. Go along, Nancy, that's a good girl. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go upstairs and take a message for me to Mrs Manningham. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you please tell her that she is to come down here this instant, whether she is suffering from a sick headache or any other form of ailment. -- {Dismissal, Making another person feel inadequate}\n[Mr Manningham]: Just like that, Nancy. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: (stepping forward) What do you mean, Nancy - she won't come? -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - really - the door is locked, is it? Very well... -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Never mind. Just go and get it, will you? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Or on second thoughts perhaps you need not get the dog. We will just let it be supposed that we have the dog. That will be even more delicate still. -- {Evasion, Deception}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nothing very much. Just a little smoke for getting rats out of holes. There. Run along. -- {Dismissal, Deception}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go on, Nancy. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah - so I thought. Very well, Nancy. Now I shall be obliged if you will go to bed at once. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go to bed. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Good-night, Nancy. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: (indicating the chair he placed by the fireplace) Come and sit down in this chair, please, Bella. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Dog? What dog? -- {Evasion, Feigning ignorance}\n[Mr Manningham]: Again? This is strange talk, Bella - from you - after what you did to the dog a few weeks ago. Come and sit down there. -- {Gaslighting, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: The dog, my dear Bella, was merely a ruse to compel you to pay me a visit quietly. Come and sit down where I told you. -- {Deception, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: (shouting) Come and sit down where I told you! -- {Dismissal, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: Quite a good deal Bella. Sit down and make yourself comfortable. We have plenty of time. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: (calmly) Sit down and make yourself comfortable, Bella. We have plenty of time. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now you are not sitting in the chair I indicated, Bella. -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n\n\n[Mr Manningham]: I have to say that you are not sitting in the chair I indicated. Are you afraid of me that you desire to get so near the door? -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed. Then you have a good deal of courage, my dear. However, will you now sit down where I told you? -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you know what you remind me of, Bella, as you walk across the room? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Haven't you? Not that funny, glazed, dazed look of the wandering mind - the body that acts without the soul to guide it? I have often thought you had that look, but it's never been so strong as tonight. -- {Dismissal, Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then may I ask why you are still fully dressed? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you hear what I said? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then will you tell me why, since you had gone to bed. you are still fully dressed? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: You don't know? Do you know anything about anything you do? -- {Dismissal, Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You forgot to undress. A curious oversight, if I may say so, Bella. You know, you give me the appearance of having had a rather exciting time since I last saw you. Almost as though you have been up to something. Have you been up to something? -- {Provocation, Accusations based on assumptions}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you find that bill I told you to find? -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: (moving to the table and picking up the milk jug) Do you remember what I said would happen to you if you did not find that bill when I returned tonight? -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Am I married to a dumb woman, Bella, in addition to all else? The array of your physical and mental deficiencies is growing almost overwhelming. I advise you to answer me. -- {Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: I asked you if you remembered something. (He moves back to the fireplace with a glass of milk) Go on, Bella - what was it I asked you if you remembered? -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Admirable, my dear Bella! Admirable! We shall make a great logician of you yet - a Socrates - a John Stuart Mill! You shall go down to history as the shining mind of your day. That is, if your present history does not altogether submerge you - take you away from your fellow creatures. And there is a danger of that, you know, in more ways than one. Well - what did I say I would do if you did not find that bill? -- {Sarcasm, Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. And do you believe me to be a man of my word? -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: You see, Bella, in a life of considerable and varied experience I have hammered out a few principles of action. In fact I actually fancy I know how to deal with my fellow men. I learned it quite early, actually - at school, in fact. There, you know, there were two ways of getting at what you wanted. One was along an intellectual plane, the other along the physical. If one failed one used the other. I took that lesson into life with me. Hitherto, with you, I have worked, with what forbearance and patience I leave you to judge, along the intellectual plane. The time has come now, I believe, to work along the other as well ... You will understand that I am a man of some power ... -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why do you look at me, Bella? I said I am a man of some power and determination, and as fully capable in one direction as in the other... I will leave your imagination to work on what I mean... However, we are really digressing ... You did not find the bill I told you to find. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you look for it? (He moves towards the bureau) -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Around the room. Where around the room? (Pause) In my desk, for instance? -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you imagine you can lie to me? -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, listen to me. Your dark, confused, rambling mind has led you into playing some pretty tricks tonight - has it not? -- {Dismissal, Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Your mind is indeed tired. Your mind is so tired that it cannolongerworkatall. You do notthink. You dream. Dream all day long. Dream everything. Dream maliciously and incessantly. Don't you know that by now? You sleep-walking imbecile, what have you been dreaming tonight - where has your mind wandered - that you have split open my desk? What strange diseased dream have you had tonight - eh? -- {Dismissal, Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: All that happened when, Bella? Tonight? Of course you dreamed all that happened - or rather all that didn't happen. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: (simultaneously) Sit down and be quiet. Sit down! -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: (more quietly and inquisitively) What was this dream of yours, Bella? You interest me. -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: (now very inquisitively) You dreamed of a man, Bella? What man did you dream of, pray? -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: I know you dreamed it, you gibbering wretch! I want to know more about this man of whom you dreamed. Do you hear! Do you hear me! -- {Dismissal, Belittiling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: (after a pause) May I ask who the devil you are, and how you got in? -- {Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: And would you be kind enough to tell me what you are doing here? -- {Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: Don't you think you had better explain your business, sir? -- {Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella. Go to your room. -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: I shall find out the meaning of this, and deal with you in due course. -- {Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go to your room. I will call you down later. I have not finished with you yet, madam. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Done what? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, sir - will you have the goodness to tell me your name, and your business, if any? -- {Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you going to explain your business, sir, or am I going to fetch a policeman and have you turned out? -- {Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: (after a pause) You give me the impression, sir, that you have something up your sleeve. Will you go on with what you were saying? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: What impression? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have noticed it. -- {Indifference}\n\n[Rough]: Eerie, isn't it? Now we are almost in the dark... Why do you think that has happened? You don't suppose a light has been put on somewhere else ... You don't suppose that strangers have entered the house? You don't supposethereare other spirits - fellow spirits of mine - spirits surrounding this house now - spirits of justice, even, which have caught up with you at last, Mr Manningham? -- {Provocation, Accusation, Dramatization}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you off your head, sir? -- {Dismissal, Belittiling}\n[Rough]: No, sir. Just an old man seeing ghosts. It must be the atmosphere of this house. (Walking about) I can see them everywhere. It's the oddest thing. Do you know one ghost I can see, Mr Manningham? You could hardly believe it. -- {Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: Why, it's the ghost of an old woman, sir - the ghost of an old woman twenty years ago - an old woman who once lived in this house, who once lived in this very room. Yes - in this very room. What things I imagine! -- {Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: Remarkably clear, sir, I see it... An old woman getting ready to go to bed - here in this very room - an old woman getting ready to go up to bed at the end of the day. Why! There she is. She sits just there. And now it seems I see another ghost as well. -- {Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: I see the ghost of a young man, Mr Manningham - a handsome, tall, well-groomed young man. But this young man has murder in his eyes. Why, God bless my soul, he might be you, Mr Manningham - he might be you! The old woman sees him. Don' t you see it all? She screams - screams for help - screams before her throat is cut - cut open with a knife. She lies dead on the floor - the floor of this room of this house. There! (Pause) Now I don't see that ghost any more. -- {Accusation, Provocation, Dramatization}\n[Mr Manningham]: What's the game - eh? What's the game? -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Rough]: But I still see the ghost of the man. I see him, all through the night, as he ransacks the house, hour after hour, room after room, ripping everything up. turning everything out, madly seeking the thing he cannot find. Then twenty years pass, and where is he? Why, sir, is he not still in the same house, the house he ransacked, the house he searched - and does he not now stand before the ghost of the woman he killed, in the room in which he killed her? A methodical man, apatient man, but perhaps he has waited too long. For justice has waited too, and here she is, in my person, to exact her due. And justice found, my friend, in one hour what you sought for twenty years, and still could not find. See here. Look what she found. (He moves to the bureau and picks up the bill, the letter and the brooch as he mentions them) First a bill which your wife had lost. Then a letter which never reached your wife. Then a brooch which you gave your wife but which she lost. How wicked of her! But then she didn't know its value. How was she to know that it held the Barlow Rubies. There (He opens out the brooch) See. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! There you are, sir! You killed one woman for those and tried to drive another out of her mind. And all the time they lay in your own desk, and all they have brought you is a rope around your neck! Well, the game is over, Sydney Power, and I advise you to take the matter philosophically. -- {Accusation, Provocation, Dramatization, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: You seem, sir, to have some very remarkable information. Do you imagine you are going to leave this room with such information in your possession? (He moves to the door as though to lock it) -- {Dismissal, Threats}\n[Rough]: Do you imagine, sir, that you are going to leave this room without suitable escort? -- {Provocation, Threats}\n[Rough]: Only that I have men in the house already. Didn't you realize that they had signalled their arrival from above, your own way in, Mr Manningham, when the light went down? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Rough]: (going up to Mr Manningham) Sydney Charles Power, I have a warrant for your arrest for the murder of Alice Barlow. I should warn you that anything you may say now may be taken down in writing and used as evidence at a later date. Will you accompany us to the station in a peaceful manner? You will oblige us all, and serve your own interests best, Power, by coming with us quietly ... -- {Accusation, Threats}\n[Rough]: Very well - take him away ... -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to my husband. -- {Demanding}\n[Rough]: Now, surely, there's nothing to be - - -- {Dismissal, Not attempting to understand}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to my husband. -- {Demanding}\n[Rough]: Very well, my dear, what do you want to say? -- {Ignoring boundaries, Not attempting to understand}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to him alone. -- {Demanding}\n[Rough]: Alone? -- {Ignoring boundaries, Not attempting to understand}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, alone. Won't you please let me speak to him alone. I beg of you to allow me. I will not keep him long. -- {Demanding}\n[Rough]: This is anything but in order - but we will wait outside. I'm afraid you must not be long, Mrs Manningham. -- {Ignoring boundaries, Not attempting to understand}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I do not want you to listen. -- {Demanding}\n[Rough]: No, I will not listen. -- {Ignoring boundaries, Not attempting to understand}\n[Mr Manningham]: (struggling at his bonds, half-whispering) Take it easy, Bella. You're clever. Get something to cut this and I'll get away. I can get out through the dressing-room, and make a jump for it. Can you get something? -- {Manipulation, Demanding}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, I can get something. What can I get? -- {Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: There's a razor in my dressing-room. In there! Quick! Be quick! Go and get it! -- {Manipulation, Demanding}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. I will get it! I will get it for you. -- {Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: There's a good girl. You're a good girl. Quick! Be quick! -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Key? What key? You are not suggesting that this is a key I hold in my hand? Have you gone mad, my husband? (She hurls the key across the room) -- {Gaslighting, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: What's the game, Bella? -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (Moving to Rough, completely hysterical) Come and take this man away! -- {Demanding, Accusation}\n[Rough]: Now, my dear, come and sit down. Well, my child, there's all your life ahead now. It's Devonshire cream for you, and the sparkle back in your eyes. But you've had a bad time. I came in from nowhere and gave you the most horrible evening of your life, didn't I? The most horrible evening of anybody's life, I should imagine. -- {Dismissal, Not offering constructive solutions, Normalizing bad behaviour}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: What are you doing, Bella? -- {Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Nothing, dear... (She moves back to the window to look out) Don't wake yourself. -- {Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: (closing his eyes again) What are you doing, Bella? Come here ... -- {Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Only for tea, my dear. Muffins - for tea ... (She takes his hand) -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Muffins ... Eh ... ? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, dear ... He only comes so seldom ... I thought I might surprise you. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why are you so apprehensive, Bella? I was not about to reproach you. -- {Gaslighting}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (nervously releasing his hand) No, dear. I know you weren't. (She moves back to the window) -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: This fire's in ashes. Ring the bell, will you, Bella dear, please? -- {Demanding}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... (She moves towards the bell, but stops) Is it merely to put coal on, my dear? I can do that. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now then, Bella. We've had this out before. Be so good as to ring the bell. -- {Ignoring boundaries, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But, dear - Lizzie's out in the street. Let me do it. I can do it so easily. (She moves over to the fireplace) -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: (stopping her with an outstretched hand) No, no, no, no, no ... Where's the girl? Let the girl come up if Lizzie's out. -- {Ignoring boundaries, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But, my dear - - -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go and ring the bell, please, Bella - there's a good child. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: What do you suppose the servants are for, Bella? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (shamefacedly, and scarcely audibly, merely dutifully feeding him) To serve us, I suppose, Jack ... -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Precisely. Then why - - ? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But I think we should consider them a little, that's all. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Consider them? There's your extraordinary confusion of the mind again. You speak as though they work for no consideration. I happen to consider Elizabeth to the tune of sixteen pounds per annum. And the girl ten. Twenty-six pounds a year all told. And if that is not consideration of the most acute and lively kind, I should like to know what is. -- {Gaslighting, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, Jack. I expect you are right. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have no doubt of it, my dear. It's sheer weak mindedness to think otherwise. (Pause) What's the weather doing? Is it still as yellow? -- {Gaslighting, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, it seems to be denser than ever. Shall you be going out in this, Jack dear? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - I expect so. Unless it gets very much worse after tea. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Nancy]: Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought the bell rang ... -- {Feigning ignorance}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, we rang the bell, Nancy... (Pause) Go on, my dear, tell her why we rang the bell. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh ... Yes... We want some coal on the fire, Nancy, please. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. (She gets the matches, with another barely discernible little smile, and lights the two incandescent mantles during the following) -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: You're looking very impudent and pretty this afternoon, Nancy. Do you know that? -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Nancy]: I don't know that at all, sir, I'm sure. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What is it? Another broken heart added to your list? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Nancy]: I wasn't aware of breaking any hearts, sir. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: I'm sure that's not true. And that complexion of yours. That's not true, either. I wonder what mysterious lotions you've been employing to enhance your natural beauties. -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Nancy]: I'm quite natural, sir. I promise you. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: But you do it adroitly, I grant you that. What are your secrets? Won't you tell us the name of your chemist? Perhaps you could pass it on to Mrs Manningham - and help banish her pallor. She would be most grateful, I have no doubt. -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Nancy]: I'd be most happy to, I'm sure, sir. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Or are women too jealous of their discoveries to pass them on to a rival? -- {Provocation, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: I don't know, sir ... Will that be all you're wanting, sir? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. That's all I want, Nancy - except my tea. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause, reproachfully rather than angrily) Oh, Jack, how can you treat me like that? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: But, my dear, you're the mistress of the house. It was your business to tell her to put the coal on. -- {Gaslighting, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It isn't that! It's humiliating me like that. As though I'd do anything to my face, and ask for her assistance if I did. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: But you seem to look upon the servants as our natural equals. So I treated her as one. (He picks up his paper and sits down on the settee) Besides, I was only trifling with her. -- {Gaslighting, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It's strange that you can't see how you hurt me. That girl laughs at me enough already. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Laughs at you? What an idea. What makes you think she laughs at you? -- {Gaslighting}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh - I know she does in secret. In fact, she does so openly - more openly every day. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: But, my dear- if she does that, doesn't the fault lie with you? -- {Gaslighting, Blaming}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) You mean that I am a laughable person? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't mean anything. It's you who read meanings into everything, Bella dear. I wish you weren't such a perfect little silly. Come here and stop it. I've just thought of something rather nice. -- {Gaslighting, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Something nice? What have you thought of, Jack? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: I shan't tell you unless you come here. -- {Patronizing, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (going over and sitting on the little stool beside him) What is it. Jack? What have you thought of? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: I read that Mr MacNaughton - the celebrated actor - is in London for another season. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. I read that. What of it. Jack? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: What of it? What do you suppose? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, Jack dear. Do you mean it? Would you take me to see MacNaughton? You wouldn't take me to see MacNaughton, would you? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: I not only would take you to see MacNaughton, my dear. I am going to take you to see MacNaughton. That is, if you want to go. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, Jack! What heaven - what heaven! -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: When would you like to go? (He refers to the newspaper) You have only three weeks, according to his advertisement. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh - what perfect heaven! Let me see. Do let me see! -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: (showing her the advertisement) There. You see? You can see him in comedy or tragedy - according to your choice. Which would you prefer. Bella - the comedy or the tragedy? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh - it's so hard to say! Either would be equally wonderful. Which would you choose, if you were me? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well - it depends - doesn't it - upon whether you want to laugh, or whether you want to cry. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh - I want to laugh. But then, I should like to cry, too. In fact, I should like to do both. Oh, Jack, what made you decide to take me? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, my dear, you've been very good lately, and I thought it would be well to take you out of yourself. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, Jack dear. You have been so much kinder lately. Is it possible you're beginning to see my point of view? -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't know that I ever differed from it, did I, Bella? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, Jack dear. It's true. It's true. All I need is to be taken out of myself - some little changes - to have some attention from you. Oh, Jack, I'd be better - I could really try to be better - you know in what way - if only I could get out of myself a little more. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: How do you mean, my dear, exactly, better? -- {None}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You know ... You know in what way, dear. About - all that's happened lately. We said we wouldn't speak about it. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, no - don't let's speak about that. -- {Ignoring, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No, dear, I don't want to - but what I say is so important. I have been better - even in the last week. Haven't you noticed it? And why is it? Because you have stayed in, and been kind to me. The other night when you stayed in and played cards with me, it was like the old days, and I went to bed feeling a normal, happy, healthy human being. And then, the day after, when you read your book to me, Jack, and we sat by the fire, I felt all my love for you coming back, then, Jack. And I slept that night like a child. All those ghastly dreads and terrible, terrible fears seemed to have vanished. And all just because you had given me your time, and taken me from brooding on myself in this house all day and night. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: I wonder if it is that - or whether it's merely that your medicine is beginning to benefit you? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No, Jack, dear, it's not my medicine. I've taken my medicine religiously - haven't I taken it religiously? Much as I detest it! It's more than medicine that I want. It's the medicine of a sweet, sane mind, of being interested in something. Don't you see what I mean? -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well - we are talking about gloomy subjects, aren't we? -- {Dismissal, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. I don't want to be gloomy, dear - that's the last thing I want to be. I only want you to understand. Say you understand. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, dear. Don't I seem to? Haven't I just said I'm taking you to the theatre? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, dear ... Yes, you have. Oh, and you've made me so happy - so happy, dear. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, then, which is it to be - the comedy or the tragedy? You must make up your mind. -- {None}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (with exulting solemnity) Oh, Jack, which shall it be? Which shall it be? (She rises and shows her pleasure with delighted gestures) It matters so little! Do you understand that, my husband! I'm going to the play! (She kisses him) -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: My dear - what are you doing? -- {None}\n[Mrs Manningham]: The little beast! Let her put that in her pipe and smoke it. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: But what has she done? -- {None}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Ah - you don't know her. She tries to torment and score off me all day long. You don't see these things. A man wouldn't. She thinks me a poor thing. And now she can suffer the news that you're taking me to the theatre. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: I think you imagine things, my dear. -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh no, I don't. We've been too familiar with her. (She arranges the chairs by the table in an emotionally happy state) Come along, my dear. You sit one side, and I the other, like two children in the nursery. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: (rising and standing with his back to the fire) You seem wonderfully pleased with yourself, Bella. I must take you to the theatre more often, if this is the result. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, Jack - I wish you could. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't really know why we shouldn't. I used to like nothing so much when I was a boy. In fact, you may hardly believe it, but I even had an ambition to be an actor myself at one time. -- {None}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I can well believe it, dear. Come along to your tea now. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Bella, that must be a very superb sensation. To take a part and lose yourself entirely in the character of someone else. I flatter myself I could have made an actor. -- {None}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Why, of course, my dear. You were cut out for it. Anyone can see that. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: (moving slowly L) No - do you think so - seriously? I always felt a faint tinge of regret. Of course, one would have required training, but I believe I should have made out - and might have reached the top of the tree for all I know. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: To be or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer. The slings and arrows* of outrageous fortune. Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And, by opposing, end them? -- {None}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You see how fine your voice is? Oh - you've made a great mistake. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: (sitting to the R of the table) I wonder. -- {None}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Then if you had been a famous actor, I should have had a free seat to come and watch you every night of my life. And then called for you at the stage door afterwards. Wouldn't that have been paradise? -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: A paradise of which you would soon tire, my dear. I have no doubt that after a few nights you would be staying at home again, just as you do now. -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh no, I wouldn't. I should have to keep my eye on you for all the hussies that would be after you. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: There would be hussies after me, would there? That is an added inducement, then. -- {None}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes - I know it, you wretch. But you wouldn't escape me. (She lifts the cover of the muffin dish and prepares muffins during the following) They look delicious. Aren't you glad I thought of them? Here's some salt. You want heaps of it. Oh, Jack dear, you must forgive me chattering on like this, but I'm feeling so happy. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: I can see that, my dear. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I'm being taken to the play, you see. Here you are. I used to adore these as a child, didn't you? I wonder how long it is since we had them? We haven't had them since we've been married anyway. Or have we? Have we ...? -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: (suddenly rising, looking at the wall opposite him; in a calm, yet menacing voice) I don't know, I'm sure ... I don't know ... -- {Aggression, Threats}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause, dropping her voice almost to a whisper) What is it? What's the matter? What is it now? -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: (walking over to thefireplace, and speaking with his back to her) I have no desire to upset you, Bella, but I have just observed something very much amiss. Will you please rectify it at once, while I am not looking, and we will assume that it has not happened. -- {Aggression, Threats}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Amiss? What's amiss? For God's sake don't turn your back on me. What has happened? -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know perfectly well what has happened, Bella, and if you will rectify it at once I will say no more about it. -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I don't know. I don't know. You have left your tea. Tell me what it is. Tell me. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you trying to make a fool of me, Bella? What I refer to is on the wall behind you. If you will put it back, I will forget the matter. -- {Dismissal, Invalidating, Aggression}\n[Mrs Manningham]: The wall behind me? What? (She turns) Oh ... Yes ... The picture has been taken down. Yes ... The pictures... Who has taken it down? Why has it been taken down ...? -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Why has it been taken down? Why, indeed? You alone can answer that, Bella. Why was it taken down before? Will you please take it from wherever you have hidden it, and put it back on the wall again. -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But I haven't hidden it, Jack. I didn' t do it. Oh, for God's sake look at me. I didn't do it. I don't know where it is. Someone else must have done it. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: Someone else? Are you suggesting that I should play such a fantastic and wicked trick? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No, dear, no! But someone else. (She moves to him) Before God. I didn't do it! Someone else, dear, someone else. (She reaches out to him) -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: Someone else, eh? Someone else. (Shaking her off ) Will you leave go of me. You repel me - you half-witted thing. (He walks over to the bell-cord) We will see about \"someone else\". -- {Aggression, Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh. Jack - don't ring the bell. Don't ring it. Don't call the servants to witness my shame. It's not my shame for I haven't done it - but don't call the servants! Tell them not to come. -- {None}\n[Mr Manningham]: (shaking her off violently) Will you leave go of me and sit down there! (He moves to the fireplace) Someone else - eh? Well - we shall see. -- {Aggression, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: You had better pull yourself together, hadn't you ... ? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah, Elizabeth, do you notice anything amiss in this room? Look carefully around the walls, and see if you notice anything amiss ... Well, Elizabeth, what do you notice? -- {None}\n[Elizabeth]: Nothing, sir - except the picture's been taken down. -- {None}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Exactly. The picture has been taken down. You noticed it at once. Now was that picture in its place when you dusted the room this morning? -- {Invalidating, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Neither do I, Elizabeth, neither do I. And now, before you go, just one question. Was it you who removed that picture, Elizabeth? -- {Accusation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed, why should you? And now please, will you kiss that Bible, which lies on that desk there, as a token of your truthfulness... -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Very well, you may go. And please send Nancy in here at once. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving to Mr Manningham) Jack - spare me that girl. Don't call her in. I'll say anything. I'll say that I did it. I did it, Jack, I did it. Don't have that girl in. Don't! -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you have the goodness to contain yourself? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: I did not ask for any comment on your part, Nancy. Kindly be less insolent and answer what I ask you. Did you take that picture down, or did you not? -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then, by God, you are mad, and you don't know what you do. You unhappy wretch - you're stark gibbering mad - like your wretched mother before you. -- {Accusation, Belittling, Cruel humor, Attacking}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack - you promised you would never say that again. -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (after a pause) The time has come to face facts, Bella. If this progresses you will not be much longer under my protection. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella, my dear - have you any idea where that picture is now? -- {Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then you did know where it was, Bella. You did know where it was. -- {Accusation, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: There is no sense in walking about the room with a picture in your hand, Bella. Go and put it back in its proper place. -- {Dismissal, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, Bella, I said a moment ago that we have got to face facts. And that is what we have got to do. I am not going to say anything at the moment for my feelings are running too high. In fact, I am going out immediately, and I suggest that you go to your room and lie down for a little in the dark. -- {Dismissal, Power games, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mr Manningham]: There is no question of sending you to your room, Bella. You know perfectly well that you may do exactly as you please. Everything - - -- {Gaslighting, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Very well... (He leads her to the settee) Now, take things quietly and come and sit down. Where are your salts? (He fetches a bottle of smelling salts from the cupboard) Here they are ... (He helps her with the salts. Pause) Now, my dear, I am going to leave you in peace ... -- {Invalidating, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (reclining, her eyes closed) Have you got to go? Must you go? Must you always leave me alone after these dreadful scenes? -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, no argument, please. I had to go in any case after tea, and I am merely leaving a little earlier, that's all. (He puts on his hat and coat. Pause) Now, is there anything I can get for you? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Mr Manningham]: (simultaneously) My dear. Calm yourself. Calm yourself. -- {Invalidating, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: (coming to her and shaking her violently) Will you control yourself! Will you control yourself! Listen to me, madam, if you utter another sound I'll knock you down and take you to your room and lock you in darkness for a week. I have been too lenient with you, and I mean to alter my tactics. -- {Threats, Power games, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: May God help you, indeed. Now listen to me. I am going to leave you until ten o'clock. In that time you will recover that paper, and admit to me that you have lyingly and purposely concealed it... If not, you will take the consequences. You are going to see a doctor, madam, more than one doctor - and they shall decide what this means. Now do you understand me? -- {Threats, Power games, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (moving to the door) I have been patient with you and controlled myself long enough. It is no w for you to control yourself, or take the consequences. Think upon that, Bella. -- {Gaslighting, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack... Jack... Don't go ... Jack ... You're still going to take me to the theatre, aren't you? -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: What a question to ask me at such a time. No, madam, emphatically I am not. You play fair by me, and I'll play fair by you. If we are going to be enemies, you and I, you will find that it is I who shall get the best of it. -- {Threats, Power games}\n\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes!... Yes!... What is it. Elizabeth? Leave me alone. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: Madam, there's somebody called. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Who is it? I don't want to be disturbed. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: It's a gentleman, madam - he wants to see you. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Tell him to go. Elizabeth. He wants to see my husband. My husband's out. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: No, madam - he wants to see you. You must see him, madam. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, leave me alone. Tell him to go away. I want to be left alone. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: Madam, madam. I don't know what's going on between you and the master, but you've got to hold up, madam. You've got to hold up. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I am going out of my mind, Elizabeth. That's what's going on. -- {Exaggeration}\n[Elizabeth]: Don't talk like that, madam. You've got to be brave. You mustn't go on lying here in the dark, or your mind will go. You must see this gentleman. It's you he wants - not the master. He's waiting below. Come, madam, it'll take you out of yourself. -- {Ignoring previous conflict, Not offering constructive solutions}\n[Rough]: You're very much afraid you don't know me from Adam? That's about the root of the matter, isn't it? -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Rough]: You're a good deal younger and more attractive than I thought, you know. But you're looking very pale. Have you been crying? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: You will do so, madam, very shortly. (He moves L and removes his scarf during the following) You're the lady who's going off her head, aren't you? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: I very much doubt whether God knows anything of the sort, Mrs Manningham. Had he done so I believe he would have come to your aid before this. But I am here, and so you must give me your faith. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Rough]: I'm afraid I shall have to keep you in the dark for a little, Mrs Manningham, as I am still quite far down in the dark myself. Can I have another lump of sugar in this? -- {Keeping others in the dark, Evasion}\n[Rough]: Before I go any further, Mrs Manningham, I must tell you there's a leakage in this household. You have a maid called Nancy? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Oh, no - no such retribution is going to overtake her at the moment, Mrs Manningham. In fact, I fancy you are going to be heavily in debt to your maid, Nancy. If it were not for her indiscretions I should not be here now, should I? -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Rough]: I'm afraid I shall have to keep you in the dark for a little, Mrs Manningham, as I am still quite far down in the dark myself. Can I have another lump of sugar in this? -- {Keeping others in the dark, Evasion}\n[Rough]: Now, Mrs Manningham, to ask a personal question: when did you first get the notion into your head that your reason was playing you tricks? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: Is it the house itself you fear, Mrs Manningham? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: And has the top floor got anything to do with it? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: Now - have you ever been up to that top floor? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: Not even a servant to dust. -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: Rather funny? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Rough]: Ah - now you interest me beyond measure. Do tell me about the top floor. -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Rough]: It never struck you, did it, that it might be your own husband walking about up there? -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes - that is what I thought - but I thought I must be mad. Tell me how you knew. -- {Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: Why not tell me first how you knew, Mrs Manningham. -- {Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It's true, then! I knew it. I knew it! When he leaves this house he comes back. He comes back and walks up there above - up and down - up and down. He comes back like a ghost. How does he get up there? -- {Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: That's what we're going to find out, Mrs Manningham. But there are such commonplace resources as roofs and fire escapes, you know. Now please don't look so frightened. Your husband is no ghost, believe me, and you are very far from mad. Tell me now, what made you first think it was him? -- {Diminishing, Dismissing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It was the light - the gaslight ... It went down and it went up ... Oh, thank God I can tell this to someone at last. I don't know who you are, but I must tell you. -- {Exaggeration}\n[Rough]: Now try to keep calm. You can tell me just as well sitting down, can't you? Won't you sit down? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Every night, after he goes out, I find myself waiting for something. Then all at once I look round the room and see that the light is slowly going down. At first I tried not to notice it, but after a time it began to get on my nerves. I would go all over the house to see if anyone had put on an extra light, but they never had. It's always the same time - about ten minutes after he goes out. That's what made me think that somehow he had come back and that it was he who was walking about up there. I go up to the bedroom but I daren't stay there because I hear noises overhead. I want to scream and run out of the house. I sit here for hours, terrified, waiting for him to come back, and I always know when he's coming again. Suddenly the light goes up again and ten minutes afterwards I hear his key in the lock downstairs, and he's back again. -- {Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: How very strange, indeed. You know. Mrs Manningham, you should have been a policeman. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Are you laughing at me? Do you think I imagine everything too? -- {Accusation}\n[Rough]: Oh no! I was merely praising the keenness of your observation. I not only think you are right in your suppositions, I think you have made a very remarkable discovery, and one which may have very far-reaching consequences. -- {Patronizing, Invalidating}\n[Rough]: Well, let's leave it for the moment. Tell me, that is not the only cause, is it, which has lately given you reason to doubt your sanity? Has anything else been happening? Don't be afraid to tell me. -- {Patronizing, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: Tricks? What sort of tricks? When? -- {Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Incessantly - but more and more of late. He gives me things to look after, and when he asks for them they are gone, and can never be found. Then he misses his rings, or his studs, or his razors, and I will hunt the place for them, and he will find them lying hidden at the bottom of my work-box. Twice the door of that room was found locked with the key vanished. That was also found at the bottom of my box. Only today, before you came, that picture had been taken from the wall and hidden. Who could have done it but myself? I try to remember. I break my heart trying to remember. But I can't. Oh, and then there was that terrible business about the dog ... -- {Exaggeration, Victim playing}\n[Rough]: The dog? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: We have a little dog. A few weeks ago, it was found with its paw hurt... He believes - oh God, how can I tell you what he believes - that I had hurt the dog. He does not let the dog near me now. He keeps it in the kitchen and I am not allowed to see it! I begin to doubt, don't you see? I begin to believe I imagine everything. Perhaps I do. Are you here? Is this a dream, too? Who are you? I'm afraid they are going to lock me up. -- {Victim playing, Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: (putting his hands on hers) Do you know, Mrs Manningham, it has occurred to me that you'd be all the better for a little medicine. -- {Patronizing, Manipulation}\n[Rough]: No. I'm not a doctor, but that doesn't mean that a little medicine would do you any harm. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Oh - but mine'san exceptional medicine. I have some with me now. You must try it. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: You shall sample it and see. (He rises and goes over to his coat) You see, it has been employed by humanity, for several ages, for the purpose of the instantaneous removal of dark fears and doubt. That seems to fit you. doesn't it? -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Ah - that we don'tknow.The fact remains that it does. Here we are. (He produces a bottle of whisky) You see, it comes from Scotland. Now, madam, have you such a thing handy as two glasses or two cups? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Oh yes. In fact, I am having some above all things. We could use these cups, if you like. -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: (pouring two whiskies) You underestimate your powers, Mrs Manningham. You see, I don't want you thinking you can't trust your reason. This will give you faith in your reason like nothing else... Now for some water... All right, this will do. (He picks up the jug and pours water into Mrs Manningham's glass) There! (He hands the glass to her) Tell me - (pouring water into his own glass) did you ever hear of \"The Cabman's Friend\", Mrs Manningham? -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Yes. How nice to see you smile. Here's to your very good health. (He drinks) Go on ... There ... Is it so nasty? -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Ah, then you're a hardened whisky drinker. But you'11 enjoy it better sitting down. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Ah. \"The Cabman's Friend\". (He moves to the mantelpiece) You should ask me who was \"The Cabman's Friend\", Mrs Manningham, for she was an old lady who died many, many years ago. (He puts his whisky on the mantelpiece) -- {Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: A great deal, I fancy, if you will follow me patiently. Her name was Barlow - Alice Barlow, and she was an old lady of great wealth, and decided eccentricities. In fact, her principal mania in life was the protection of cabmen. You may think that an extraordinary hobby, but in her odd way she did a lot of good. She provided these men with shelters, clothing, pensions, and so forth, and that was her little contribution to the sum of the world's happiness, or rather her little stand against the sum of the world's pain. There is a great deal of pain in this world, Mrs Manningham, you know. Well, it was not my privilege to know her, but it was my duty, on just one occasion, to see her. That was when her throat was cut open, and she lay dead on the floor of her own house. -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n[Rough]: Yes. She was murdered. I was only a comparatively young officer at the time, but it made an extremely horrible, in fact I may say lasting, impression on me. The murderer was never discovered but the motive was obvious enough. The Barlow Rubies had been inherited by her, and it was well known that she kept them, without any proper precautions, in her bedroom on an upper floor. She lived alone except for a deaf servant in the basement. Well, for that she paid the penalty of her life. -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n[Rough]: There were some sensational features about the case. The man seemed to have got in at about ten at night and stayed till dawn. Apart, presumably, from the jewels, there were only a few trinkets taken, but the whole house had been turned upside down, and in the upper room every single thing was flung about, or torn open. Even the cushions of the chairs were ripped up with his bloody knife, and the police decided that it must have been a revengeful maniac as well as a robber. I had other theories but I was a nobody then, and not in charge of the case. -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n[Rough]: Well, it seemed to me, from all that I gathered here and there, that the old lady might have been an eccentric, but that she was by no means a fool. It seemed to me that she might have been one too clever for that man. We presume he killed her to silence her, but what then? What if she had not been so careless? What if she had got those jewels hidden away in some inconceivably cunning place, in the walls, floored down, bricked in, maybe? What if the only person who could tell him where they were was lying dead on the floor! Would not that account, Mrs Manningham, for all the strange confusion in which the place was found. Can't you picture him. Mrs Manningham, searching through the night, ransacking the place, hour after hour, growing more and more desperate, until at last the dawn comes and he has to slink out into the pale street, the blood and wreckage of the night behind. And the deaf servant down in the basement sleeping like a dog through it all. -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n[Rough]: No, Mrs Manningham, the man was never found. Nor has the Barlow jewellery ever come to light. -- {Changing the topic, Unrelated comments}\n\n[Rough]: I think he is almost certainly alive today, but I don't believe he found what he wanted. That is, if my theory is right. -- {Evasion, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Then the jewels may still be where the old lady hid them? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Indeed, Mrs Manningham, if my theory is right, the jewels must still be where she hid them, but then, of course, it was only a theory and that formed in quite a young man, long enough ago. The official conclusion was quite otherwise. The police, naturally and quite excusably presumed that the murderer had got them, and there was no re-opening of matters in those days. Soon enough the public forgot about it. I forgot about it myself. But it would be funny, wouldn't it, Mrs Manningham, if after all these years I should turn out to be right. -- {Diminishing, Indifference, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, yes, indeed. But what has this to do with me? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Ah, that is the whole question, Mrs Manningham. What, indeed? What has the obscure murder of an old lady twenty years ago to do with an attractive, though I am afraid at present somewhat pale and wan young lady in this house, who believes she is going out of her mind, and watches the gaslight going up and down when her husband is out at night? Well, I believe there is a link, however remote, wild and strange it may be, and that is why I am here. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It's all so confusing. Won't you - - -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Do you conceive it possible, Mrs Manningham, that that man might not have given up hope of one day getting at the treasure which lay there, and have bided his time until he could somehow re-enter the house? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. Yes. Possibly. But how - - ? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Can you conceive that he may have waited years - five years, ten years, fifteen years, twenty years even - time in which he may have done many things: gone abroad, got married even, until at last his chance came to resume the search begun on that terrible night? You don't follow where I am leading at all, do you, Mrs Manningham? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Follow you? Yes, I think so. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: You know, Mrs Manningham, of the old theory that the criminal always returns to the scene of his crime. Ah, yes, but in this case there is something more than morbid compulsion. There is treasure there to be unearthed if only he can search again, search methodically, without fear of interruption, without causing suspicion. And how would he do that? Don't you think ... -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Quiet! Be quiet! He has come back! Look! Look at the light! It is going down! Wait! -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: What's the matter, Mrs Manningham? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: There! He has come back, you see. He is upstairs now. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: (moving to the window) Dear me, now. How very odd that is. How very odd, indeed. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: He is in the house, I tell you. You must go. He will know you are here. You must go. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: How dark it is. You could hardly see to read. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You must go. He is in the house. Please go. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) Quiet, Mrs Manningham, quiet! You have got to keep your head. Don't you see my meaning, yet? Don't you understand that this was the house? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: House? What house? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: The old woman's house, Mrs Manningham. This house, here, these rooms, these walls. Twenty years ago Alice Barlow lay dead in this room. Twenty years ago the man who murdered her ransacked this house - below and above - but could not find what he sought. What if he is still searching, Mrs Manningham? What if he is up there - still searching? Now do you see why you must keep your head? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But my husband, my husband is up there! -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Precisely that, Mrs Manningham. Your husband. (He fetches the glass of whiskyfrom the mantelpiece) You see, I am afraid you are married to a tolerantly dangerous gentleman. Now drink this quickly, as we have a great deal to do. (He holds out the glass to her) -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: This house ... How do you know this was the house? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Why, ma'am, because I was on the case, and came here myself, that's all. -- {Evasion, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Mrs Manningham]: The idea is mad, mad. I have been married seven years. How can you imagine my husband is - what you imagine he may be? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham ... -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: (pouring himself another whisky) When the police came into this place twenty years ago, as you can understand there was a lot of routine work to be done - interviewing of relatives and friends and so forth. Most of that was left to me. -- {Evasion, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Well? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Well, amongst all the acquaintances and relatives, nephews and nieces, et cetera, that I interviewed, there happened to be a young man by the name of Sydney Power. I suppose you have never heard that name at all, have you? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Power? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Yes. Sydney Power. It conveys nothing to you? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Sydney Power. No ... -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Well, he was a kind of distant cousin apparently much attached to the old lady, and even assisting her in her good works. The only thing was that I remembered his face. Well. I saw that face again about five weeks ago. It took me a whole day to discover where I had seen it before, but I remembered it at last. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Well - what of it? What if you did remember him? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: It was not so much my remembering Mr Sydney Power, Mrs Manningham. What startled me was the lady on his arm, and the locality in which I saw him. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh - who was the lady on his arm? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: You were the lady on his arm, Mrs Manningham, and you were walking down this street. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What are you saying? Do you mean you think my husband - my husband is this Mr Power? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Well, not exactly, for if my theories are right - - -- {Evasion, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What are you saying? You stand there talking riddles. You are so cold. You are as heartless and cold as he is. -- {Accusation, Exaggerated accusations}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) No, Mrs Manningham, I am not cold, and I am not talking riddles. I am just trying to preserve a cold and calculating tone, because you are up against the most awful moment in your life, and your whole future depends on what you are going to do in the next hour. Nothing less. You have got to strike for your freedom, and strike now, for the moment may not come again. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Strike - - -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: You are not going out of your mind, Mrs Manningham, you are slowly, methodically, systematically being driven out of your mind. And why? Because you are married to a criminal maniac who is afraid you are beginning to know too much - a criminal maniac who steals back to his own house at night, still searching for something he could not find twenty years ago. Those are the facts, wild and incredible as they may seem. His name is no more Manningham than mine is. He is Sydney Power and he murdered Alice Barlow in this house. He changed his name, and he has waited all these years, until he found it safe to acquire this house in a legal way. He then acquired the empty house next door. Every night, for the last few weeks, he has entered that house from the back, climbed up on to its roof and come into this house by the skylight. I know that because I have seen him do it. You have watched the gaslight, and been aware of the same thing. He is up there now. Why he should employ this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting at what he wants, God himself only knows. For the same reason, perhaps, that he employs this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting rid of you: that is by slowly driving you mad and sending you into a lunatic asylum. Thank God you are not married to him, and that I have come here to save you from the workings of his wicked mind. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Not married? Not married? He married me. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: I have no doubt he did, Mrs Manningham. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, he contracted the same sort of union with another lady many years before he met you. Moreover the lady is still alive, and the English law has a highly exacting taste in monogamy. You see, I have been finding things out about Mr Sydney Power. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Are you speaking the truth? My God - are you speaking the truth? Where is his wife now? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: If my guesses are right, she is the length of the world away - on the continent of Australia to be precise, where I know for a fact he spent five years. Did you know that? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. I did not know that. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Ah, yes. If only I could find her, everything would be easier, and that's the whole root of the matter, Mrs Manningham. So far I am only dealing in guesses and half facts. I have got to have evidence, and that is why I came to see you. You have got to give me the evidence or help me find it. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: This is my husband. Don't you understand - this is my husband. He married me. Do you ask me to betray the man who married me? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: By which you mean, of course, the man who has betrayed you into thinking that you are married to him - don't you? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But I'm married to him. You must go. I must think this out. You must go. I must cling to the man I married. Mustn't I? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Indeed, cling to him by all means, but do not imagine you are the only piece of ivy. You can cling to him if you desire, as his fancy women cling to him in the low resorts of the town. That is the sort of wall you have to cling to, ma'am. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Women? What are you suggesting? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: I'm not suggesting anything. I am only telling you what I have seen. He comes to life at night, this gentleman upstairs, in more ways than one. I have made it my business to follow him on some of his less serious excursions, and I can promise you he has a taste in unemployed actresses which he is at no pains to conceal. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Is this the truth? Are you telling me the truth? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham - will you look me in the eyes again, and see if you think I am telling you the truth? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Yes. I have known it. How strange that is ... I have known it all along ... -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham, it is hard to take everything from you, but you are no more tied to this man. you are under no more obligation to him than those wretched women in those places. You must learn to be thankful for that. -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What do you want me to do? What do you want? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: (completely changing his tone, striding up and down in a business like way) I want his papers, Mrs Manningham - his identity. There is some clue somewhere in this house, and we have got to get at it. Where does he keep his papers? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Papers? I know of no papers. Unless his bureau ... -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Yes. His bureau? His bureau? -- {Gaslighting, Making others feel insecure, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. There. (She points to the bureau) But he keeps it always locked. I have never seen it open. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n\n[Rough]: Oh - it doesn't look so formidable. (He fetches a ring of keys and implementsfrom his overcoat pocket during the following) You know, Mrs Manningham, one of the greatest regrets of my life is that fate never made me one of two things: one was a gardener, the other a burglar - both quiet occupations, Mrs Manningham. As for the last, if I'd started young, and worked my way up, I should have been a genius. Now let's have a look at this. -- {Diminishing, Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But you must not touch this. He will know what you have done. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Come now, ma'am. You're working with me, aren't you - not against me? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But you must not tamper with that. He will know what you have done. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Not if we are clever enough. And this one here doesn't even ask for cleverness ... You see, Mrs Manningham, there are all manner of -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Rough]: Do as I say, and ring the bell. At once, please. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring, Demanding}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, what shall I do? What shall I say to him? You must go at once. Why do you want Elizabeth? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (putting on his overcoat) All in good time. He's not going to jump through the window, you know. In fact he can't be round at our front door in less than five minutes - unless he's a magician. Now can you see anything that I've missed? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Are you anxious to help your mistress, blindly, without asking any questions? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring, Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Good. Now, Elizabeth, Mrs Manningham and I have reason to suppose that in about five minutes' time the master is returning to this house. I do not think it is advisable to leave the house at the moment, as I might be seen doing so by the master. Would you be good enough to take me down to your kitchen and hide me away for a short space of time? You can put me in the oven if you like. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring, Manipulation}\n[Rough]: (kindly taking her hand) Come now, Elizabeth. Are you or are you not? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring, Manipulation}\n[Rough]: (really excited for the first time) Yes, quick. He's coming. Don't you understand. Go there and stay there. Take her, Elizabeth. You have a bad headache - a bad headache. (Turning from the gaslight; quite angrily) Will you take her, in heaven's name! -- {Dismissal, Ignoring, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Where is Mrs Manningham, Elizabeth? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: I think she's gone to bed, sir. I think she had a bad headache and went to bed. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, indeed. And how long has the good lady been in bed, do you know? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh. I see. Then we must be quiet, mustn't we? Walk about like cats ... Can you walk about like a cat, Elizabeth? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: (trying to smile) Yes, sir. I think so, sir. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: Very well, Elizabeth. Walk about like a cat. All right. That's all. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. (She heads for the door) -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: Er - Elizabeth. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Yes, sir? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Why haven't you cleared away the tea things? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Oh - I'm sorry, sir. I was really just about to, sir. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: I think you had better clear away the tea things, Elizabeth. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Yes, sir. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: (After a pause, putting a dish on the tray) Excuse me, sir, but were you going to have some supper, sir? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, yes. I am going to have supper. The question is, am I going to have supper here? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Oh, yes, sir. Are you having it out, sir? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, I am having it out. I have come back to change my linen. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: (stopping again) Do you want a fresh collar, sir? Shall I get you a fresh collar? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why, do you know where my collars are kept? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Why yes, sir. In your room, there, sir. Shall I get you one, sir? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: What a lot you know, Elizabeth. And do you know the sort of collar I want tonight? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Why, yes, sir ... I think I know the sort of collar, sir ... -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Then all I can say is you know a great deal more than I do ... No ... I think you must let me choose my own collar ... (He moves towards the door R and stops) That is, if I have your permission, Elizabeth. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: What did you think about Mrs Manningham tonight, Elizabeth? -- {Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. I doubt if you guess to what extent she is unwell. Or are you beginning to guess? -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: I'm afraid I was compelled to drag you and Nancy into our troubles tonight. Perhaps I should not have done that. -- {Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Mr Manningham]: I'm at my wits' end, Elizabeth. Don't you know that? -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have tried everything. Kindness, patience, cunning - even harshness, to bring her to her senses. But nothing will stop these wild, wild hallucinations, nothing will stop these wicked pranks and tricks. -- {Exaggeration, Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: You don't know a quarter of it, Elizabeth. You only see what is forced upon your attention - as it was tonight. You have no conception of what goes on all the time. -- {Making others feel insecure, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: She died in the mad-house, Elizabeth, without any brain at all in the end. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: I mean to say, you know what goes on. You can testify to what goes on, can't you? -- {Manipulation, Making others more dependent on them for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed, you may have to testify in the end. Do you realize that? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: There now, how touching. I thank you, Elizabeth. You will be repaid later for what you have said, and repaid in more ways than one. You understand that, don't you? -- {Manipulation, Power games, Promising rewards}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, I know that. Well, Elizabeth, I am going out. In fact, I' m even going to try and be a little gay. Can you understand that, or do you think it is wrong? -- {Manipulation, Evasion}\n[Rough]: He was right when he said you would be repaid, Elizabeth. Though not in the way he thinks. -- {Reactive abuse, Distortion}\n[Rough]: Now I'm afraid you're one ahead of me, Mrs Manningham. -- {Invalidation}\n[Rough]: Really now. (He takes the bill from her) Well, well, the essence of a good trick is its simplicity, isn't it? -- {Dismissal, Belittling}\n[Rough]: Is his correspondence with your relations very much to the point at the moment, Mrs Manningham? -- {Dismissal, Not attempting to understand}\n[Rough]: Poor thing. Poor thing. You shall have your Devonshire cream, my dear, and you shall have your fresh air to bring the sparkle back into your eyes. Why, I can see a sparkle in them already. If you will be brave now, you will not have to wait so long. Are you going to be brave? -- {Patronizing, Manipulation}\n[Rough]: I have no idea what you will say when he comes back, Mrs Manningham. But then I have no idea what you will do when he comes back, Mrs Manningham, if I have no evidence to remove you from his loving care for good. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n\n[Rough]: There is only one thing we can do - go ahead. If we go back now, we are lost. I am going to force it and gamble on finding something. Are you with me? -- {Dismissal, Not attempting to understand}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But don't you see... All right. Force it. Force it. But be quick. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: There's no hurry, ma'am. He's quite happy where he is... Now I don't like - (straining at the lock) violent methods - of this sort - it makes me feel like a dentist... There ... -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Is there anything in there? Is there anything there? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Nothing at present, I' m afraid... Nothing at present... Wait a minute ... No ... No ... (Looking at a document) What's this? -- {Giving too brief or incomplete answers, Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Is there nothing? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: One moment... No ... Not a thing. We have lost our gamble, ma'am, I'm afraid. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, dear. What are we to do? -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: Some rapid thinking at the moment. Don't have any fear, Mrs Manningham, I've been in many a tighter corner than this. Let's get these things back to begin with, shall we? Give me the watch and the brooch. We must put them back where they were. -- {Dismissal, Not attempting to understand}\n[Rough]: Secondhand, eh? I'm afraid you got everything secondhand from this gentleman, Mrs Manningham. -- {Belittiling, Making other feel like they are doing something wrong}\n[Rough]: Really. I should have thought that as simple as ABC. Have you got the others? There should be four more. -- {Belittiling, Making other feel like they are doing something wrong}\n[Rough]: For that is your immediate fate at the moment. (He puts down the brooch and moves to her) My dear Mrs Manningham - (he kisses her) my dear, dear Mrs Manningham! Don't you understand? -- {Belittiling, Making other feel like they are doing something wrong, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Rough]: Don't you see? Don't you see the whole thing? This is where the old lady hid her treasure at night - in a common trinket she wore all the day. I knew I had seen this somewhere before. And where was that? In portraits of the old lady - when I was on the case. She wore it on her breast. I remember it clearly though it was twenty years ago. Twenty years ago! Dear God in heaven, am I not a wonderful man? -- {Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: And all because he could not resist a little common theft along with the big game ... Well, it is I who am after the big game now. -- {Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: Have the goodness to stop making a fool of yourself, Mrs Manningham. Here's your courage. (He gives her the bottle of whisky) Take some more of it, but don't get tipsy and don't leave it about. Goodbye. -- {Dismissal, Belittiling, Making other feel like they are doing something wrong}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, Nancy, I did ring. It seems that the entire household has gone to bed, without leaving me my milk and without leaving me my biscuits. -- {Complaining}\n[Mr Manningham]: Quite, Nancy. Then perhaps you will deputize for Mrs Manningham, and bring them into the room. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you ever know a time when Mrs Manningham did not have a headache, Nancy? -- {Belittiling, Making other feel like they are doing something wrong}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you usually perform your domestic tasks in outdoor costume, Nancy? -- {Belittiling, Making other feel like they are doing something wrong}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you be so good as to come closer, Nancy, where I can see you. -- {Dismissal}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Have you any idea of the time of the day, or rather night, Nancy? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. I thought I saw you, sir. -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - you thought you saw me. Well, I certainly saw you. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Have you ever reflected, Nancy, that you are given a great deal of latitude in this house? -- {Diminishing, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: I don't know, sir. I don't know what latitude means. -- {Feigning ignorance}\n[Mr Manningham]: Latitude, Nancy, means considerable liberty - liberty to the extent of two nights off a week. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, that's all very well. It is not so well, however, when you return as late as the master of the house. We ought to keep up some pretences, you know. -- {Patronizing, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (in a more human tone) Where the devil have you been tonight, anyway? -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Nancy]: Only with some friends, sir. -- {Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, gentleman friends have been known to take decided liberties with young ladies like yourself. Are you alive to such a possibility? -- {Patronizing, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Nancy, pretty as your bonnet is, it is not anything near so pretty as your hair beneath it. Won't you take it off and let me see it? -- {Patronizing, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Nancy]: Very good, sir. It comes off easy enough. (She takes her bonnet off) There ... Is there anything more you want, sir? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Possibly. Come here, will you, Nancy? -- {Patronizing, Ignoring boundaries}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir ... (She moves to him) Is there anything you want, sir ...? -- {Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Nancy]: (Her tone changing) What do you want? Eh? What do you want? -- {Accusation}\n[Nancy]: There! Can she do that for you? Can she do that? -- {Provocation, Comparison}\n[Mr Manningham]: Who can you be talking about, Nancy? -- {Feigning ignorance}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Nancy, you are a very remarkable girl in many respects. I believe you are jealous of your mistress. -- {Patronizing, Accusation}\n[Nancy]: She? She's a poor thing. There's no need to be jealous of her. You want to kiss me again, don't you. Don't you want to kiss me? -- {Dismissal, Provocation}\n[Nancy]: There! That's better than a sick headache - ain't it? - a sick headache and a pale face all the day. -- {Provocation, Comparison}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why yes, Nancy, I believe it is. I think, however, don't you, that it would be better if you and I met one evening in different surroundings. -- {Patronizing, Manipulation}\n[Nancy]: Yes. Where? I'll meet you when you like. You're mine now - ain't you? - 'cos you want me. You want me - don't you? -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: And what of you, Nancy? Do you want me? -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Nancy]: Oh, yes! I always wanted you, ever since I first clapped eyes on you. I wanted you more than all of them. -- {Exaggeration, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - there are plenty of others? -- {Patronizing, Accusation}\n[Nancy]: Oh, yes - there's plenty of others. -- {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Mr Manningham]: So I rather imagined. And only nineteen. -- {Patronizing, Accusation}\n[Nancy]: Where can we meet? Where do you want us to meet? -- {Evasion, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Really, Nancy, you have taken me a little by surprise. I'll let you know tomorrow. -- {Evasion, Procrastination}\n[Nancy]: How'll you let me know, when she's about? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, I'll find a way. -- {Evasion, Dismissal}\n[Nancy]: Not that I care for her. I'd like to kiss you under her very nose. That's what I'd like to do. -- {Provocation, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: All right, Nancy. Now you had better go. I have some work to do. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: Go? I don't want to go. -- {Dismissal, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: There, run along. I have some work to do. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: Work? What are you going to work at? What are you going to do? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - I'm going to write some letters. Go along, Nancy, that's a good girl. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: Oh, very well, sir. You shall be master for a little more. (She kisses him) Good-night, your lordship. -- {Sarcasm, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: Good-night. -- {Dismissal}\n[Nancy]: (moving to the door) When shall you let me know tomorrow? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (going to the bureau and pulling out his keys) When I find time, Nancy, when I find time. Good-night. -- {Dismissal, Procrastination}\n[Nancy]: Yes. What is it now? -- {Impatience, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go upstairs and take a message for me to Mrs Manningham. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: Yes. What do you want me to say? -- {Impatience, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you please tell her that she is to come down here this instant, whether she is suffering from a sick headache or any other form of ailment. -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Nancy]: Just like that, sir? -- {Provocation, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: Just like that, Nancy. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: With the greatest of pleasure, sir. -- {Sarcasm, Disrespect}\n[Nancy]: She won't come. She doesn't mean to come. -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (stepping forward) What do you mean, Nancy - she won't come? -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Nancy]: She said she can't come - she's not well enough. She's just shamming, if you ask me. -- {Accusation, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Really? Then she forces me to be undignified. (He walks over to the door) All right, Nancy, leave it to me. -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Nancy]: The door's locked. She's got it locked. I tried it. -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - really - the door is locked, is it? Very well... (He heads past her) -- {Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Nancy]: She won't let you in. I can tell by her voice. She's got it locked and she won't open it. Are you going to batter it in? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: No - perhaps you are right, Nancy ... Let us try more delicate means of attaining our ends... (He goes to the bureau and writes a note during the following) Perhaps you will take a note to this wretched imbecile and slip it under her door. -- {Dismissal, Accusation, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: Yes. I'll do that. What are you going to write? -- {Provocation, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Never mind what I am going to write. I'll tell you what you can do though, Nancy. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: Yes? What? -- {Impatience, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Just go down to the basement and bring the little dog here, will you? -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Nancy]: The dog? -- {Confusing others, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: The dog, yes. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: What's the game? What's the idea with the dog? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Never mind. Just go and get it, will you? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: All right. (She moves to the door) -- {Dismissal, Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Mr Manningham]: Or on second thoughts perhaps you need not get the dog. We will just let it be supposed that we have the dog. That will be even more delicate still. (He holds out the note to Nancy) Here you are, Nancy. Please go and put this under the door. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing, Manipulation}\n[Nancy]: (after a pause; taking the letter) What's the idea? What have you written in this? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nothing very much. Just a little smoke for getting rats out of holes. There. Run along. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing, Deception}\n[Nancy]: You're arum beggar, ain't you? (She moves to the door) Can't I look? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go on, Nancy. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: She's coming. It's done the trick all right. -- {Dismissal, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah - so I thought. Very well, Nancy. Now I shall be obliged if you will go to bed at once. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: Go on. What's the game? What's the row about? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go to bed. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: (comingforward to him) All right, I'm going. (She kisses him) Good night, old dear. Give her what-for, won't you? -- {Provocation, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: Good-night, Nancy. -- {Dismissal}\n[Nancy]: Ta-ta. (She heads for the door) -- {Dismissal, Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Nancy]: Perhaps you will let me pass, madam. -- {Dismissal, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: (indicating the chair he placed by the fireplace) Come and sit down in this chair, please, Bella. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (not moving) Where is the dog? Where have you got the dog? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Dog? What dog? -- {Feigning ignorance, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You said you had the dog. Have you hurt it? Let me have it. Where is it? Have you hurt it again? -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Again? This is strange talk, Bella - from you - after what you did to the dog a few weeks ago. Come and sit down there. -- {Gaslighting, Accusation, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I do not want to speak to you. I am not well. I thought you had the dog and were going to hurt it. That is why I came down. -- {Accusation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: The dog, my dear Bella, was merely a ruse to compel you to pay me a visit quietly. Come and sit down where I told you. -- {Gaslighting, Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. I want to go. -- {Dismissal, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (shouting) Come and sit down where I told you! -- {Dismissal, Patronizing, Hostility}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving DS) Yes ... Yes ... What do you want? -- {Dismissal, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Quite a good deal Bella. Sit down and make yourself comfortable. We have plenty of time. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to go. You cannot keep me here. I want to go. -- {Dismissal, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (calmly) Sit down and make yourself comfortable, Bella. We have plenty of time. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (going to a chair other than the one indicated and which is nearer the door) Say what you have to say. -- {Dismissal, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now you are not sitting in the chair I indicated, Bella. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: I have to say that you are not sitting in the chair I indicated. Are you afraid of me that you desire to get so near the door? -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed. Then you have a good deal of courage, my dear. However, will you now sit down where I told you? -- {Diminishing, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you know what you remind me of, Bella, as you walk across the room? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Haven't you? Not that funny, glazed, dazed look of the wandering mind - the body that acts without the soul to guide it? I have often thought you had that look, but it's never been so strong as tonight. -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then may I ask why you are still fully dressed? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then will you tell me why, since you had gone to bed. you are still fully dressed? -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: You don't know? Do you know anything about anything you do? -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You forgot to undress. A curious oversight, if I may say so, Bella. You know, you give me the appearance of having had a rather exciting time since I last saw you. Almost as though you have been up to something. Have you been up to something? -- {Provocation, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you find that bill I told you to find? -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Am I married to a dumb woman, Bella, in addition to all else? The array of your physical and mental deficiencies is growing almost overwhelming. I advise you to answer me. -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: It is not necessary for you to tell me that, Bella. I am just wondering if it might interrupt its gyratory motion for a fraction of a second, and concentrate upon the present conversation. Now please, what was it I a moment ago asked you if you remembered? -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Admirable, my dear Bella! Admirable! We shall make a great logician of you yet - a Socrates - a John Stuart Mill! You shall go down to history as the shining mind of your day. That is, if your present history does not altogether submerge you - take you away from your fellow creatures. And there is a danger of that, you know, in more ways than one. Well - what did I say I would do if you did not find that bill? -- {Sarcasm, Belittling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. And do you believe me to be a man of my word? -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: You see, Bella, in a life of considerable and varied experience I have hammered out a few principles of action. In fact I actually fancy I know how to deal with my fellow men. I learned it quite early, actually - at school, in fact. There, you know, there were two ways of getting at what you wanted. One was along an intellectual plane, the other along the physical. If one failed one used the other. I took that lesson into life with me. Hitherto, with you, I have worked, with what forbearance and patience I leave you to judge, along the intellectual plane. The time has come now, I believe, to work along the other as well ... You will understand that I am a man of some power ... -- {Power games, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why do you look at me, Bella? I said I am a man of some power and determination, and as fully capable in one direction as in the other... I will leave your imagination to work on what I mean... However, we are really digressing ... You did not find the bill I told you to find. -- {Power games, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you look for it? (He moves towards the bureau) -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Around the room. Where around the room? (Pause) In my desk, for instance? -- {Power games, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you imagine you can lie to me? -- {Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, listen to me. Your dark, confused, rambling mind has led you into playing some pretty tricks tonight - has it not? -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Your mind is indeed tired. Your mind is so tired that it cannolongerworkatall. You do notthink. You dream. Dream all day long. Dream everything. Dream maliciously and incessantly. Don't you know that by now? You sleep-walking imbecile, what have you been dreaming tonight - where has your mind wandered - that you have split open my desk? What strange diseased dream have you had tonight - eh? -- {Belittling, Making others feel insecure, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: All that happened when, Bella? Tonight? Of course you dreamed all that happened - or rather all that didn't happen. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: Have I not told you ? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: (simultaneously) Sit down and be quiet. Sit down! -- {Power games, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: (more quietly and inquisitively) What was this dream of yours, Bella? You interest me. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: I know you dreamed it, you gibbering wretch! I want to know more about this man of whom you dreamed. Do you hear! Do you hear me! -- {Belittling, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella. Go to your room. -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: I shall find out the meaning of this, and deal with you in due course. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go to your room. I will call you down later. I have not finished with you yet, madam. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Rough]: Youknow, I believe you're wrong there, Manningham. I believe that is just what you have done. -- {Provocation}\n[Rough]: (lighting a cigar) Ah - an admirable idea. I could have thought of nothing better myself. Yes, fetch a policeman, Manningham, and have me turned out... (Pause) Why do you wait? -- {Provocation}\n[Rough]: (standing and facing Mr Manningham) Yes. But why not fetch a policeman? -- {Provocation}\n[Rough]: Yes, certainly. Where was I? Yes. (He pauses) Excuse me, Mr Manningham, but do you get the same impression as myself? -- {Provocation}\n\n[Rough]: Eerie, isn't it? Now we are almost in the dark... Why do you think that has happened? You don't suppose a light has been put on somewhere else ... You don't suppose that strangers have entered the house? You don't supposethereare other spirits - fellow spirits of mine - spirits surrounding this house now - spirits of justice, even, which have caught up with you at last, Mr Manningham? -- {Provocation, Accusation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you off your head, sir? -- {Dismissal, Belittiling}\n[Rough]: No, sir. Just an old man seeing ghosts. It must be the atmosphere of this house. (Walking about) I can see them everywhere. It's the oddest thing. Do you know one ghost I can see, Mr Manningham? You could hardly believe it. -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Rough]: Why, it's the ghost of an old woman, sir - the ghost of an old woman twenty years ago - an old woman who once lived in this house, who once lived in this very room. Yes - in this very room. What things I imagine! -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: What are you saying? -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Remarkably clear, sir, I see it... An old woman getting ready to go to bed - here in this very room - an old woman getting ready to go up to bed at the end of the day. Why! There she is. She sits just there. And now it seems I see another ghost as well. -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Rough]: (Looking at Mr Manningham) I see the ghost of a young man, Mr Manningham - a handsome, tall, well-groomed young man. But this young man has murder in his eyes. Why, God bless my soul, he might be you, Mr Manningham - he might be you! The old woman sees him. Don' t you see it all? She screams - screams for help - screams before her throat is cut - cut open with a knife. She lies dead on the floor - the floor of this room of this house. There! (Pause) Now I don't see that ghost any more. -- {Accusation, Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: What's the game - eh? What's the game? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (confronting Manningham) But I still see the ghost of the man. I see him, all through the night, as he ransacks the house, hour after hour, room after room, ripping everything up. turning everything out, madly seeking the thing he cannot find. Then twenty years pass, and where is he? Why, sir, is he not still in the same house, the house he ransacked, the house he searched - and does he not now stand before the ghost of the woman he killed, in the room in which he killed her? A methodical man, apatient man, but perhaps he has waited too long. For justice has waited too, and here she is, in my person, to exact her due. And justice found, my friend, in one hour what you sought for twenty years, and still could not find. See here. Look what she found. (He moves to the bureau and picks up the bill, the letter and the brooch as he mentions them) First a bill which your wife had lost. Then a letter which never reached your wife. Then a brooch which you gave your wife but which she lost. How wicked of her! But then she didn't know its value. How was she to know that it held the Barlow Rubies. There (He opens out the brooch) See. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! There you are, sir! You killed one woman for those and tried to drive another out of her mind. And all the time they lay in your own desk, and all they have brought you is a rope around your neck! Well, the game is over, Sydney Power, and I advise you to take the matter philosophically. -- {Accusation, Provocation, Power games, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: You seem, sir, to have some very remarkable information. Do you imagine you are going to leave this room with such information in your possession? (He moves to the door as though to lock it) -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Rough]: Do you imagine, sir, that you are going to leave this room without suitable escort? -- {Power games, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: May I ask what you mean by that? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Only that I have men in the house already. Didn't you realize that they had signalled their arrival from above, your own way in, Mr Manningham, when the light went down? -- {Power games, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Here you... What the devil's this? (He rushes to the door and opens it) -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah, gentlemen - come in. Come in. Make yourselves at home. Here. (He makes a plunge to escape) ' -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: Leave go of me, will you? Here. Leave go of me! Here's a fine way of going on. Here's a fine way! -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (going up to Mr Manningham) Sydney Charles Power, I have a warrant for your arrest for the murder of Alice Barlow. I should warn you that anything you may say now may be taken down in writing and used as evidence at a later date. Will you accompany us to the station in a peaceful manner? You will oblige us all, and serve your own interests best, Power, by coming with us quietly ... -- {Power games, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Very well - take him away ... -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Inspector Rough ... -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) Yes, my dear, now don't you think you'd better ... -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (in a weak voice) Inspector ... -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Yes? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to my husband. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Now, surely, there's nothing to be - - -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to my husband. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Very well, my dear, what do you want to say? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to him alone. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Alone? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, alone. Won't you please let me speak to him alone. I beg of you to allow me. I will not keep him long. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (after a pause) I don't quite understand. Alone? (Pause) Very well. You may speak to him alone. (To the men) Very well. (He signals to the men that they are to tie Mr Manningham to the chair) -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: This is anything but in order - but we will wait outside. I'm afraid you must not be long, Mrs Manningham. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I do not want you to listen. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: No, I will not listen. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack! Jack! What have they done to you? What have they done? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: (struggling at his bonds, half-whispering) Take it easy, Bella. You're clever. Get something to cut this and I'll get away. I can get out through the dressing-room, and make a jump for it. Can you get something? -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, I can get something. What can I get? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: There's a razor in my dressing-room. In there! Quick! Be quick! Go and get it! -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. I will get it! I will get it for you. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mr Manningham]: There's a good girl. You're a good girl. Quick! Be quick! -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: How strange! The door is locked! -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: What do you mean - locked? There's the key, there! I see it. Tum the key, and go in! -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Key? What key? You are not suggesting that this is a key I hold in my hand? Have you gone mad, my husband? (She hurls the key across the room) -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: What's the game, Bella? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving to him) Or is it I who am mad? Yes. That is it. Of course. I am mad. It was a key, and I have lost it. Dear God - I have lost it, haven't I? I am always losing things. And I can never find them. I don't know where I put them. -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella ... -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I must look for it, mustn't I? Yes... If I don't find it you will lock me in my room - you will lock me in the mad-house for my mischief. Where could it be now? Could it be behind the picture? Yes, it must be there. (She goes to the picture and takes it down) No - it is not there - how strange. I must put the picture back, mustn't I? I have taken it down, and I must put it back. There. (She puts the picture back) Where now shall I look? The desk. Perhaps I put it in the desk. (She goes to the desk) No, it is not here. (She picks up the bill, the letter and the watch as she mentions them) Here is a bill. Here is a letter. Here is a watch. See. (She moves to him, the items in her hand) Take them. I have found them at last, you see! But they don't help you, do they? And I am trying to help you, aren't I? To help you to escape ... But how can a mad woman help her husband to escape? What a pity ... (Getting louder and louder) If I were not mad I could have helped you - if I were not mad, whatever you had done, I could have pitied and protected you! But because I am mad I have hated you, and because I am mad I have betrayed you, and because I am mad I am rejoicing with my heart - without a shred of pity - without a shred of regret - watching you go with glory in my heart! (She pauses, looking at him. She breathes deeply. She suddenly goes to the door UL and flings it open) Inspector! Inspector! Come and take this man away! Come and take this man away! -- {Manipulation, Power games, Accusation}\n[Rough]: Very well - take him along. I'll join you a little later. -- {Power games, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (Moving to Rough, completely hysterical) Come and take this man away! -- {Power games, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Now, my dear, come and sit down. Well, my child, there's all your life ahead now. It's Devonshire cream for you, and the sparkle back in your eyes. But you've had a bad time. I came in from nowhere and gave you the most horrible evening of your life, didn't I? The most horrible evening of anybody's life, I should imagine. -- {Power games, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: The most horrible ... Oh, no ... (With a sort of proud defiance) The most wonderful... Far and away the most wonderful. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: What are you doing, Bella? -- {Not caring, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Nothing, dear... (She moves back to the window to look out) Don't wake yourself. -- {Diminishing, Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Mr Manningham]: (closing his eyes again) What are you doing, Bella? Come here ... -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now then, Bella. We've had this out before. Be so good as to ring the bell. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (stopping her with an outstretched hand) No, no, no, no, no ... Where's the girl? Let the girl come up if Lizzie's out. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go and ring the bell, please, Bella - there's a good child. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: What do you suppose the servants are for, Bella? -- {Patronizing, Making other feel like they are doing something wrong}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go on. Answer me. What do you suppose servants are for? -- {Patronizing, Making other feel like they are doing something wrong}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have no doubt of it, my dear. It's sheer weak mindedness to think otherwise. -- {Invalidation, Belittiling}\n[Mr Manningham]: You're looking very impudent and pretty this afternoon, Nancy. Do you know that? -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: And that complexion of yours. That's not true, either. I wonder what mysterious lotions you've been employing to enhance your natural beauties. -- {Patronizing, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Or are women too jealous of their discoveries to pass them on to a rival? -- {Provocation, Baiting}\n[Mr Manningham]: But, my dear, you're the mistress of the house. It was your business to tell her to put the coal on. -- {Dismissal, Blaming}\n[Mr Manningham]: But you seem to look upon the servants as our natural equals. So I treated her as one. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Laughs at you? What an idea. What makes you think she laughs at you? -- {Invalidation, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: But, my dear- if she does that, doesn't the fault lie with you? -- {Blaming, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't mean anything. It's you who read meanings into everything, Bella dear. -- {Gaslighting, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: I shan't tell you unless you come here. -- {Power games, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: I not only would take you to see MacNaughton, my dear. I am going to take you to see MacNaughton. That is, if you want to go. -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, my dear, you've been very good lately, and I thought it would be well to take you out of yourself. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: I don't know that I ever differed from it, did I, Bella? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: How do you mean, my dear, exactly, better? -- {Feigning ignorance}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, no - don't let's speak about that. -- {Ignoring, Changing the topic}\n[Mr Manningham]: I wonder if it is that - or whether it's merely that your medicine is beginning to benefit you? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well - we are talking about gloomy subjects, aren't we? -- {Changing the topic}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, dear. Don't I seem to? Haven't I just said I'm taking you to the theatre? -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, then, which is it to be - the comedy or the tragedy? You must make up your mind. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mr Manningham]: I think you imagine things, my dear. -- {Gaslighting, Invalidating}\n[Mr Manningham]: You seem wonderfully pleased with yourself, Bella. I must take you to the theatre more often, if this is the result. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: A paradise of which you would soon tire, my dear. I have no doubt that after a few nights you would be staying at home again, just as you do now. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: There would be hussies after me, would there? That is an added inducement, then. -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: (suddenly rising, looking at the wall opposite him; in a calm, yet menacing voice) I don't know, I'm sure ... I don't know ... -- {Threats, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have no desire to upset you, Bella, but I have just observed something very much amiss. Will you please rectify it at once, while I am not looking, and we will assume that it has not happened. -- {Threats, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know perfectly well what has happened, Bella, and if you will rectify it at once I will say no more about it. -- {Gaslighting, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you trying to make a fool of me, Bella? What I refer to is on the wall behind you. If you will put it back, I will forget the matter. -- {Accusation, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Why has it been taken down? Why, indeed? You alone can answer that, Bella. Why was it taken down before? Will you please take it from wherever you have hidden it, and put it back on the wall again. -- {Accusation, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: Someone else? Are you suggesting that I should play such a fantastic and wicked trick? -- {Invalidation, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: Someone else, eh? Someone else. (Shaking her off ) Will you leave go of me. You repel me - you half-witted thing. (He walks over to the bell-cord) We will see about \"someone else\". -- {Accusation, Dismissal, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: (shaking her off violently) Will you leave go of me and sit down there! (He moves to the fireplace) Someone else - eh? Well - we shall see. -- {Aggression, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: You had better pull yourself together, hadn't you ... ? -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah, Elizabeth, do you notice anything amiss in this room? Look carefully around the walls, and see if you notice anything amiss ... Well, Elizabeth, what do you notice? -- {Manipulation}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Exactly. The picture has been taken down. You noticed it at once. Now was that picture in its place when you dusted the room this morning? -- {Dismissal, Not verifying the negative assumptions about the other person}\n[Mr Manningham]: Neither do I, Elizabeth, neither do I. And now, before you go, just one question. Was it you who removed that picture, Elizabeth? -- {Accusations based on assumptions}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving to Mr Manningham) Jack - spare me that girl. Don't call her in. I'll say anything. I'll say that I did it. I did it, Jack, I did it. Don't have that girl in. Don't! -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you have the goodness to contain yourself? -- {Dismissal, Not offering constructive solutions}\n[Mr Manningham]: I did not ask for any comment on your part, Nancy. Kindly be less insolent and answer what I ask you. Did you take that picture down, or did you not? -- {Dismissal, Accusations based on assumptions}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then, by God, you are mad, and you don't know what you do. You unhappy wretch - you're stark gibbering mad - like your wretched mother before you. -- {Invalidation, Attacking, Accusation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack - you promised you would never say that again. -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: The time has come to face facts, Bella. If this progresses you will not be much longer under my protection. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack - I'm going to make a last appeal to you. I'm going to make a last appeal. I'm desperate, Jack. Can' t you see that I'm desperate? If you can't, you must have a heart of stone. -- {Victim playing, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella, my dear - have you any idea where that picture is now? -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then you did know where it was, Bella. You did know where it was. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: There is no sense in walking about the room with a picture in your hand, Bella. Go and put it back in its proper place. -- {Dismissal, Not offering constructive solutions}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, Bella, I said a moment ago that we have got to face facts. And that is what we have got to do. I am not going to say anything at the moment for my feelings are running too high. In fact, I am going out immediately, and I suggest that you go to your room and lie down for a little in the dark. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring relation repair attempts, Not attempting to understand}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving DS of the table) No, no - not my room. For God's sake don't send me to my room! -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: There is no question of sending you to your room, Bella. You know perfectly well that you may do exactly as you please. Everything - - -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, no argument, please. I had to go in any case after tea, and I am merely leaving a little earlier, that's all. (He puts on his hat and coat. Pause) Now, is there anything I can get for you? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring relation repair attempts}\n[Mr Manningham]: (walking away L) My God! What new trick is this you're playing upon me? -- {Accusation, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: (coming to her and shaking her violently) Will you control yourself! Will you control yourself! Listen to me, madam, if you utter another sound I'll knock you down and take you to your room and lock you in darkness for a week. I have been too lenient with you, and I mean to alter my tactics. -- {Threats, Power games, Aggression}\n[Mr Manningham]: May God help you, indeed. Now listen to me. I am going to leave you until ten o'clock. In that time you will recover that paper, and admit to me that you have lyingly and purposely concealed it... If not, you will take the consequences. You are going to see a doctor, madam, more than one doctor - and they shall decide what this means. Now do you understand me? -- {Threats, Accusation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have been patient with you and controlled myself long enough. It is no w for you to control yourself, or take the consequences. Think upon that, Bella. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack... Jack... Don't go ... Jack ... You're still going to take me to the theatre, aren't you? -- {Victim playing}\n[Mr Manningham]: What a question to ask me at such a time. No, madam, emphatically I am not. You play fair by me, and I'll play fair by you. If we are going to be enemies, you and I, you will find that it is I who shall get the best of it. -- {Power games, Threats}\n\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes!... Yes!... What is it. Elizabeth? Leave me alone. -- {Dismissal, Impatience}\n[Elizabeth]: Madam, there's somebody called. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Who is it? I don't want to be disturbed. -- {Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: It's a gentleman, madam - he wants to see you. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Tell him to go. Elizabeth. He wants to see my husband. My husband's out. -- {Dismissal}\n[Elizabeth]: No, madam - he wants to see you. You must see him, madam. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, leave me alone. Tell him to go away. I want to be left alone. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Elizabeth]: Madam, madam. I don't know what's going on between you and the master, but you've got to hold up, madam. You've got to hold up. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I am going out of my mind, Elizabeth. That's what's going on. -- {Exaggeration}\n[Elizabeth]: Don't talk like that, madam. You've got to be brave. You mustn't go on lying here in the dark, or your mind will go. You must see this gentleman. It's you he wants - not the master. He's waiting below. Come, madam, it'll take you out of yourself. -- {Invalidation, Diminishing, Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, my God - what new torment is this? I'm not in a fit state, I tell you. -- {Exaggeration}\n[Elizabeth]: Come, madam. I'll turn up the light. (She does so) There. Now you'll be all right. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (sitting up on the settee) Elizabeth! What have you done? I can't have anyone in. I'm not fit to be seen. -- {Exaggeration}\n[Elizabeth]: You look all right, madam. You mustn't take on so. Now - I'll call him up. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: You're a good deal younger and more attractive than I thought, you know. But you're looking very pale. Have you been crying? -- {Ignoring boundaries, Judging}\n[Rough]: You will do so, madam, very shortly. (He moves L and removes his scarf during the following) You're the lady who's going off her head, aren't you? -- {Assumption, Judging}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving towards him) What made you say that? Who are you? What have you come to talk about? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: (taking off his coat and putting it on a chair) Well, of one thing you can be certain. I have not come to talk about the weather. Though that indeed merits a world of comment at the moment. But you're running away with things, Mrs Manningham, and asking me a good deal I can't answer at once. Instead of that, I am going to ask you a question or two ... Now, please, will you come here and give me your hands? -- {Ignoring previous conflict, Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: Now, Mrs Manningham, I want you to take a good look at me, and see if you are not looking at someone to whom you can give your trust. I am a perfect stranger to you, and you can read little in my face besides that. But I can read a great deal in yours. -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: I very much doubt whether God knows anything of the sort, Mrs Manningham. Had he done so I believe he would have come to your aid before this. But I am here, and so you must give me your faith. -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: I'm afraid I shall have to keep you in the dark for a little, Mrs Manningham, as I am still quite far down in the dark myself. Can I have another lump of sugar in this? -- {Keeping others in the dark}\n[Rough]: Thank you. We were talking about the top floor. (Helping himself to several lumps) There is a bedroom above this, and above that again is the top floor? Is that right? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Now - have you ever been up to that top floor? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Rather funny? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Before I go any further, Mrs Manningham, I must tell you there's a leakage in this household. You have a maid called Nancy? -- {Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes ... Yes... -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: And Nancy walks out of an evening with a young man named Booker in my employ. I only live a few streets away from you, you know. -- {Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, yes? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Well, there is hardly anything which goes on in this house which is not described in detail to Booker, and from that quarter it reaches me. -- {Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I knew it! I knew she talked. Now I know it, she shall be dismissed. -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Oh, no - no such retribution is going to overtake her at the moment, Mrs Manningham. In fact, I fancy you are going to be heavily in debt to your maid, Nancy. If it were not for her indiscretions I should not be here now, should I? -- {Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What do you mean? What is this mystery? You must not keep me in the dark. What is it? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: I'm afraid I shall have to keep you in the dark for a little, Mrs Manningham, as I am still quite far down in the dark myself. Can I have another lump of sugar in this? -- {Keeping others in the dark}\n[Rough]: Thank you. We were talking about the top floor. (Helping himself to several lumps) There is a bedroom above this, and above that again is the top floor? Is that right? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Now - have you ever been up to that top floor? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Rather funny? -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Ah - now you interest me beyond measure. Do tell me about the top floor. -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Never mind how I know. How did it begin? -- {Ignoring previous conflict}\n[Rough]: Is it the house itself you fear, Mrs Manningham? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: And has the top floor got anything to do with it? -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: Ah - now you interest me beyond measure. Do tell me about the top floor. -- {Manipulation}\n[Rough]: It never struck you, did it, that it might be your own husband walking about up there? -- {Manipulation, Provocation}\n\n[Rough]: Why not tell me first how you knew, Mrs Manningham. -- {Evasion}\n[Rough]: That's what we're going to find out, Mrs Manningham. But there are such commonplace resources as roofs and fire escapes, you know. Now please don't look so frightened. Your husband is no ghost, believe me, and you are very far from mad. Tell me now, what made you first think it was him? -- {Dismissal, Invalidating}\n[Rough]: How very strange, indeed. You know. Mrs Manningham, you should have been a policeman. -- {Patronizing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Are you laughing at me? Do you think I imagine everything too? -- {Feeling invalidated}\n[Rough]: Oh no! I was merely praising the keenness of your observation. I not only think you are right in your suppositions, I think you have made a very remarkable discovery, and one which may have very far-reaching consequences. -- {Patronizing}\n[Rough]: (putting his hands on hers) Do you know, Mrs Manningham, it has occurred to me that you'd be all the better for a little medicine. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Ah - that we don'tknow.The fact remains that it does. Here we are. (He produces a bottle of whisky) You see, it comes from Scotland. Now, madam, have you such a thing handy as two glasses or two cups? -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: (pouring two whiskies) You underestimate your powers, Mrs Manningham. You see, I don't want you thinking you can't trust your reason. This will give you faith in your reason like nothing else... Now for some water... All right, this will do. (He picks up the jug and pours water into Mrs Manningham's glass) There! (He hands the glass to her) Tell me - (pouring water into his own glass) did you ever hear of \"The Cabman's Friend\", Mrs Manningham? -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Ah, then you're a hardened whisky drinker. But you'11 enjoy it better sitting down. -- {Patronizing}\n[Rough]: Ah. \"The Cabman's Friend\". (He moves to the mantelpiece) You should ask me who was \"The Cabman's Friend\", Mrs Manningham, for she was an old lady who died many, many years ago. (He puts his whisky on the mantelpiece) -- {Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: Yes. She was murdered. I was only a comparatively young officer at the time, but it made an extremely horrible, in fact I may say lasting, impression on me. The murderer was never discovered but the motive was obvious enough. The Barlow Rubies had been inherited by her, and it was well known that she kept them, without any proper precautions, in her bedroom on an upper floor. She lived alone except for a deaf servant in the basement. Well, for that she paid the penalty of her life. -- {Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: Well, it seemed to me, from all that I gathered here and there, that the old lady might have been an eccentric, but that she was by no means a fool. It seemed to me that she might have been one too clever for that man. We presume he killed her to silence her, but what then? What if she had not been so careless? What if she had got those jewels hidden away in some inconceivably cunning place, in the walls, floored down, bricked in, maybe? What if the only person who could tell him where they were was lying dead on the floor! Would not that account, Mrs Manningham, for all the strange confusion in which the place was found. Can't you picture him. Mrs Manningham, searching through the night, ransacking the place, hour after hour, growing more and more desperate, until at last the dawn comes and he has to slink out into the pale street, the blood and wreckage of the night behind. And the deaf servant down in the basement sleeping like a dog through it all. -- {Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: No, Mrs Manningham, the man was never found. Nor has the Barlow jewellery ever come to light. -- {Changing the topic}\n\n[Rough]: I think he is almost certainly alive today, but I don't believe he found what he wanted. That is, if my theory is right. -- {Diminishing, Indifference}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Then the jewels may still be where the old lady hid them? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Indeed, Mrs Manningham, if my theory is right, the jewels must still be where she hid them, but then, of course, it was only a theory and that formed in quite a young man, long enough ago. The official conclusion was quite otherwise. The police, naturally and quite excusably presumed that the murderer had got them, and there was no re-opening of matters in those days. Soon enough the public forgot about it. I forgot about it myself. But it would be funny, wouldn't it, Mrs Manningham, if after all these years I should turn out to be right. -- {Dismissal, Diminishing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, yes, indeed. But what has this to do with me? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Ah, that is the whole question, Mrs Manningham. What, indeed? What has the obscure murder of an old lady twenty years ago to do with an attractive, though I am afraid at present somewhat pale and wan young lady in this house, who believes she is going out of her mind, and watches the gaslight going up and down when her husband is out at night? Well, I believe there is a link, however remote, wild and strange it may be, and that is why I am here. -- {Invalidation, Gaslighting}\n[Mrs Manningham]: It's all so confusing. Won't you - - -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Do you conceive it possible, Mrs Manningham, that that man might not have given up hope of one day getting at the treasure which lay there, and have bided his time until he could somehow re-enter the house? -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: You know, Mrs Manningham, of the old theory that the criminal always returns to the scene of his crime. Ah, yes, but in this case there is something more than morbid compulsion. There is treasure there to be unearthed if only he can search again, search methodically, without fear of interruption, without causing suspicion. And how would he do that? Don't you think ... -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Quiet! Be quiet! He has come back! Look! Look at the light! It is going down! Wait! -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: What's the matter, Mrs Manningham? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: How dark it is. You could hardly see to read. -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You must go. He is in the house. Please go. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) Quiet, Mrs Manningham, quiet! You have got to keep your head. Don't you see my meaning, yet? Don't you understand that this was the house? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mrs Manningham]: House? What house? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: The old woman's house, Mrs Manningham. This house, here, these rooms, these walls. Twenty years ago Alice Barlow lay dead in this room. Twenty years ago the man who murdered her ransacked this house - below and above - but could not find what he sought. What if he is still searching, Mrs Manningham? What if he is up there - still searching? Now do you see why you must keep your head? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But my husband, my husband is up there! -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Precisely that, Mrs Manningham. Your husband. (He fetches the glass of whiskyfrom the mantelpiece) You see, I am afraid you are married to a tolerantly dangerous gentleman. Now drink this quickly, as we have a great deal to do. (He holds out the glass to her) -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mrs Manningham]: This house ... How do you know this was the house? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Why, ma'am, because I was on the case, and came here myself, that's all. -- {Evasion}\n[Mrs Manningham]: The idea is mad, mad. I have been married seven years. How can you imagine my husband is - what you imagine he may be? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (pouring himself another whisky) When the police came into this place twenty years ago, as you can understand there was a lot of routine work to be done - interviewing of relatives and friends and so forth. Most of that was left to me. -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Well? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Well, amongst all the acquaintances and relatives, nephews and nieces, et cetera, that I interviewed, there happened to be a young man by the name of Sydney Power. I suppose you have never heard that name at all, have you? -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Power? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Yes. Sydney Power. It conveys nothing to you? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Sydney Power. No ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Well, he was a kind of distant cousin apparently much attached to the old lady, and even assisting her in her good works. The only thing was that I remembered his face. Well. I saw that face again about five weeks ago. It took me a whole day to discover where I had seen it before, but I remembered it at last. -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Well - what of it? What if you did remember him? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: It was not so much my remembering Mr Sydney Power, Mrs Manningham. What startled me was the lady on his arm, and the locality in which I saw him. -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh - who was the lady on his arm? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: You were the lady on his arm, Mrs Manningham, and you were walking down this street. -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What are you saying? Do you mean you think my husband - my husband is this Mr Power? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Well, not exactly, for if my theories are right - - -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What are you saying? You stand there talking riddles. You are so cold. You are as heartless and cold as he is. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) No, Mrs Manningham, I am not cold, and I am not talking riddles. I am just trying to preserve a cold and calculating tone, because you are up against the most awful moment in your life, and your whole future depends on what you are going to do in the next hour. Nothing less. You have got to strike for your freedom, and strike now, for the moment may not come again. -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Strike - - -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: You are not going out of your mind, Mrs Manningham, you are slowly, methodically, systematically being driven out of your mind. And why? Because you are married to a criminal maniac who is afraid you are beginning to know too much - a criminal maniac who steals back to his own house at night, still searching for something he could not find twenty years ago. Those are the facts, wild and incredible as they may seem. His name is no more Manningham than mine is. He is Sydney Power and he murdered Alice Barlow in this house. He changed his name, and he has waited all these years, until he found it safe to acquire this house in a legal way. He then acquired the empty house next door. Every night, for the last few weeks, he has entered that house from the back, climbed up on to its roof and come into this house by the skylight. I know that because I have seen him do it. You have watched the gaslight, and been aware of the same thing. He is up there now. Why he should employ this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting at what he wants, God himself only knows. For the same reason, perhaps, that he employs this mad, secretive, circuitous way of getting rid of you: that is by slowly driving you mad and sending you into a lunatic asylum. Thank God you are not married to him, and that I have come here to save you from the workings of his wicked mind. -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality, Manipulation}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Not married? Not married? He married me. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: I have no doubt he did, Mrs Manningham. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, he contracted the same sort of union with another lady many years before he met you. Moreover the lady is still alive, and the English law has a highly exacting taste in monogamy. You see, I have been finding things out about Mr Sydney Power. -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Are you speaking the truth? My God - are you speaking the truth? Where is his wife now? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: If my guesses are right, she is the length of the world away - on the continent of Australia to be precise, where I know for a fact he spent five years. Did you know that? -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mrs Manningham]: No. I did not know that. -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Ah, yes. If only I could find her, everything would be easier, and that's the whole root of the matter, Mrs Manningham. So far I am only dealing in guesses and half facts. I have got to have evidence, and that is why I came to see you. You have got to give me the evidence or help me find it. -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mrs Manningham]: This is my husband. Don't you understand - this is my husband. He married me. Do you ask me to betray the man who married me? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: By which you mean, of course, the man who has betrayed you into thinking that you are married to him - don't you? -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But I'm married to him. You must go. I must think this out. You must go. I must cling to the man I married. Mustn't I? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Indeed, cling to him by all means, but do not imagine you are the only piece of ivy. You can cling to him if you desire, as his fancy women cling to him in the low resorts of the town. That is the sort of wall you have to cling to, ma'am. -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Women? What are you suggesting? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: I'm not suggesting anything. I am only telling you what I have seen. He comes to life at night, this gentleman upstairs, in more ways than one. I have made it my business to follow him on some of his less serious excursions, and I can promise you he has a taste in unemployed actresses which he is at no pains to conceal. -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Is this the truth? Are you telling me the truth? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham - will you look me in the eyes again, and see if you think I am telling you the truth? -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (after a pause) Yes. I have known it. How strange that is ... I have known it all along ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Mrs Manningham, it is hard to take everything from you, but you are no more tied to this man. you are under no more obligation to him than those wretched women in those places. You must learn to be thankful for that. -- {Gaslighting, Making others question their own reality}\n[Mrs Manningham]: What do you want me to do? What do you want? -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (completely changing his tone, striding up and down in a business like way) I want his papers, Mrs Manningham - his identity. There is some clue somewhere in this house, and we have got to get at it. Where does he keep his papers? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Papers? I know of no papers. Unless his bureau ... -- {Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Yes. His bureau? His bureau? -- {Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. There. (She points to the bureau) But he keeps it always locked. I have never seen it open. -- {Ignoring}\n\n[Rough]: Oh - it doesn't look so formidable. (He fetches a ring of keys and implementsfrom his overcoat pocket during the following) You know, Mrs Manningham, one of the greatest regrets of my life is that fate never made me one of two things: one was a gardener, the other a burglar - both quiet occupations, Mrs Manningham. As for the last, if I'd started young, and worked my way up, I should have been a genius. Now let's have a look at this. -- {Ignoring, Disregarding boundaries, Dismissal}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But you must not touch this. He will know what you have done. -- {Warning}\n[Rough]: Come now, ma'am. You're working with me, aren't you - not against me? (He looks at the bureau) Yes ... Yes... Now do you mind if I take off my coat? I'm a man who never feels at work until his coat's off. (He takes off his jacket, revealing a pink fancy shirt) Quite a saucy shirt, don't you think? You didn 't suspect I was such a dandy, did you? Now. (He goes over to the bureau) Let's have a real look at this. -- {Ignoring, Disregarding boundaries, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Not if we are clever enough. And this one here doesn't even ask for cleverness ... You see, Mrs Manningham, there are all manner of -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: God bless my soul. This looks as if the unexpected has entered in, and our plans are going awry. -- {Dismissal}\n[Rough]: (looking up ruminatively, without moving) I wonder. Yes. Well, well ... (He begins to put on his jacket) Now - please - will you go and ring that bell for Elizabeth. -- {Ignoring, Dismissal}\n[Rough]: Do as I say, and ring the bell. At once, please. -- {Demanding}\n[Rough]: (putting on his overcoat) All in good time. He's not going to jump through the window, you know. In fact he can't be round at our front door in less than five minutes - unless he's a magician. Now can you see anything that I've missed? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Ah ... Elizabeth ... Come here will you? -- {Demanding}\n[Rough]: Are you anxious to help your mistress, blindly, without asking any questions? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Rough]: (kindly taking her hand) Come now, Elizabeth. Are you or are you not? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Rough]: Good. Now, Elizabeth, Mrs Manningham and I have reason to suppose that in about five minutes' time the master is returning to this house. I do not think it is advisable to leave the house at the moment, as I might be seen doing so by the master. Would you be good enough to take me down to your kitchen and hide me away for a short space of time? You can put me in the oven if you like. -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information, Taking advantage}\n[Rough]: You think of everything, Elizabeth, and you're a good soul. (He moves to the door UR) Where does this lead to. and what's the matter with this? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Rough]: Perfect accommodation. (He goes to the window for another peep. He sees something) Yes, there he is. Now we really have got to hurry. Get off to bed, Mrs Manningham, quick. And you, Elizabeth, go to your room. You can't get downstairs in time. Hurry, please. Elizabeth, turn down that lamp. (He turns down the gaslights during the following) -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information, Taking advantage}\n[Rough]: (really excited for the first time) Yes, quick. He's coming. Don't you understand. Go there and stay there. Take her, Elizabeth. You have a bad headache - a bad headache. (Turning from the gaslight; quite angrily) Will you take her, in heaven's name! -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information, Taking advantage}\n[Mr Manningham]: Where is Mrs Manningham, Elizabeth? -- {Demanding}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, indeed. And how long has the good lady been in bed, do you know? -- {Demanding, Sarcasm}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh. I see. Then we must be quiet, mustn't we? Walk about like cats ... Can you walk about like a cat, Elizabeth? -- {Patronizing, Ridiculing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Why haven't you cleared away the tea things? -- {Demanding, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: I think you had better clear away the tea things, Elizabeth. -- {Demanding}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, yes. I am going to have supper. The question is, am I going to have supper here? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why, do you know where my collars are kept? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: What a lot you know, Elizabeth. And do you know the sort of collar I want tonight? -- {Patronizing, Ridiculing}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Then all I can say is you know a great deal more than I do ... No ... I think you must let me choose my own collar ... (He moves towards the door R and stops) That is, if I have your permission, Elizabeth. -- {Diminishing, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: What did you think about Mrs Manningham tonight, Elizabeth? -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. I doubt if you guess to what extent she is unwell. Or are you beginning to guess? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: I'm afraid I was compelled to drag you and Nancy into our troubles tonight. Perhaps I should not have done that. -- {Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have tried everything. Kindness, patience, cunning - even harshness, to bring her to her senses. But nothing will stop these wild, wild hallucinations, nothing will stop these wicked pranks and tricks. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: You don't know a quarter of it, Elizabeth. You only see what is forced upon your attention - as it was tonight. You have no conception of what goes on all the time. -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: She died in the mad-house, Elizabeth, without any brain at all in the end. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: I mean to say, you know what goes on. You can testify to what goes on, can't you? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed, you may have to testify in the end. Do you realize that? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mr Manningham]: You're a very good soul. I sometimes wonder how you put up with things in this household - this dark household. I wonder why you do not go. You're very loyal. -- {Patronizing, Making other feel like they are doing something wrong}\n[Mr Manningham]: There now, how touching. I thank you, Elizabeth. You will be repaid later for what you have said, and repaid in more ways than one. You understand that, don't you? -- {Manipulation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, I know that. Well, Elizabeth, I am going out. In fact, I' m even going to try and be a little gay. Can you understand that, or do you think it is wrong? -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: I wonder... Yes... I wonder - it's a curious existence, isn't it? Well - good-night, Elizabeth. (He heads for the door) -- {Evasion, Changing the topic}\n[Rough]: He was right when he said you would be repaid, Elizabeth. Though not in the way he thinks. -- {Invalidating, Undermining}\n[Mr Manningham]: Really now. (He takes the bill from her) Well, well, the essence of a good trick is its simplicity, isn't it? -- {Gaslighting, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: If you will be brave now, you will not have to wait so long. Are you going to be brave? -- {Patronizing, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Rough]: I have no idea what you will say when he comes back, Mrs Manningham. But then I have no idea what you will do when he comes back, Mrs Manningham, if I have no evidence to remove you from his loving care for good. -- {Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n\n[Rough]: There is only one thing we can do - go ahead. If we go back now, we are lost. I am going to force it and gamble on finding something. Are you with me? -- {Taking advantage, Power games}\n[Mrs Manningham]: But don't you see... All right. Force it. Force it. But be quick. -- {Diminishing, Acting as if nothing remarkable happened}\n[Rough]: (working on the lock) There's no hurry, ma'am. He's quite happy where he is... Now I don't like - (straining at the lock) violent methods - of this sort - it makes me feel like a dentist... There ... -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Is there anything in there? Is there anything there? -- {Evasion, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Rough]: Nothing at present, I' m afraid... Nothing at present... Wait a minute ... No ... No ... (Looking at a document) What's this? -- {Ignoring, Silent treatment}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Is there nothing? -- {Ignoring, Silent treatment}\n[Rough]: (looking more closely) One moment... No ... Not a thing. We have lost our gamble, ma'am, I'm afraid. -- {Dismissal, Dismissing}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Oh, dear. What are we to do? -- {Dismissal, Dismissing}\n[Rough]: Some rapid thinking at the moment. Don't have any fear, Mrs Manningham, I've been in many a tighter corner than this. Let's get these things back to begin with, shall we? Give me the watch and the brooch. We must put them back where they were. -- {Dismissal, Dismissing}\n[Rough]: Secondhand, eh? I'm afraid you got everything secondhand from this gentleman, Mrs Manningham. -- {Invalidation, Disrespect}\n[Rough]: For that is your immediate fate at the moment. (He puts down the brooch and moves to her) My dear Mrs Manningham - (he kisses her) my dear, dear Mrs Manningham! Don't you understand? -- {Provocation, Baiting}\n[Rough]: Don't you see? Don't you see the whole thing? This is where the old lady hid her treasure at night - in a common trinket she wore all the day. I knew I had seen this somewhere before. And where was that? In portraits of the old lady - when I was on the case. She wore it on her breast. I remember it clearly though it was twenty years ago. Twenty years ago! Dear God in heaven, am I not a wonderful man? -- {Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Mrs Manningham]: And I had it all the time. I had it all the time. -- {Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Rough]: Have the goodness to stop making a fool of yourself, Mrs Manningham. Here's your courage. (He gives her the bottle of whisky) Take some more of it, but don't get tipsy and don't leave it about. Goodbye. -- {Dismissal, Disrespect}\n[Rough]: Goodbye. (He goes out but turns back before completely closing the door) Mrs Manningham. -- {Dismissal, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes, Nancy, I did ring. It seems that the entire household has gone to bed, without leaving me my milk and without leaving me my biscuits. -- {Complaining, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: And before you do that, Nancy, will you go upstairs and tell Mrs Manningham that I wish to see her down here. -- {Demanding, Creating artificial obligations}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - she still has a headache, has she? -- {Dismissal, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: Did you ever know a time when Mrs Manningham did not have a headache, Nancy? -- {Dismissal, Disrespect}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you usually perform your domestic tasks in outdoor costume, Nancy? -- {Judging, Ridiculing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you be so good as to come closer, Nancy, where I can see you. -- {Demanding, Ignoring boundaries}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: Have you any idea of the time of the day, or rather night, Nancy? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - you thought you saw me. Well, I certainly saw you. -- {Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Have you ever reflected, Nancy, that you are given a great deal of latitude in this house? -- {Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Latitude, Nancy, means considerable liberty - liberty to the extent of two nights off a week. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Well, that's all very well. It is not so well, however, when you return as late as the master of the house. We ought to keep up some pretences, you know. -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: (in a more human tone) Where the devil have you been tonight, anyway? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, gentleman friends have been known to take decided liberties with young ladies like yourself. Are you alive to such a possibility? -- {Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you always so anxious to look after yourself? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Nancy, pretty as your bonnet is, it is not anything near so pretty as your hair beneath it. Won't you take it off and let me see it? -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. Possibly. Come here, will you, Nancy? -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: You know, Nancy, you are a very remarkable girl in many respects. I believe you are jealous of your mistress. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why yes, Nancy, I believe it is. I think, however, don't you, that it would be better if you and I met one evening in different surroundings. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: And what of you, Nancy? Do you want me? -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - there are plenty of others? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Really, Nancy, you have taken me a little by surprise. I'll let you know tomorrow. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh, I'll find a way. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: All right, Nancy. Now you had better go. I have some work to do. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: There, run along. I have some work to do. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - I'm going to write some letters. Go along, Nancy, that's a good girl. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go upstairs and take a message for me to Mrs Manningham. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Will you please tell her that she is to come down here this instant, whether she is suffering from a sick headache or any other form of ailment. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: (stepping forward) What do you mean, Nancy - she won't come? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Really? Then she forces me to be undignified. (He walks over to the door) All right, Nancy, leave it to me. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Oh - really - the door is locked, is it? Very well... (He heads past her) -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Never mind. Just go and get it, will you? -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Or on second thoughts perhaps you need not get the dog. We will just let it be supposed that we have the dog. That will be even more delicate still. (He holds out the note to Nancy) Here you are, Nancy. Please go and put this under the door. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nothing very much. Just a little smoke for getting rats out of holes. There. Run along. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing, Dismissal}\n[Mr Manningham]: Ah - so I thought. Very well, Nancy. Now I shall be obliged if you will go to bed at once. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Nancy, will you please go to bed. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (shouting) Come and sit down where I told you! -- {Aggression, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: (calmly) Sit down and make yourself comfortable, Bella. We have plenty of time. -- {Manipulation, Patronizing}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now you are not sitting in the chair I indicated, Bella. -- {Dismissal, Patronizing}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. I thought I saw you, sir. -- {Dismissing, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Did you, sir? -- {Dismissing, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: I don't know, sir. I don't know what latitude means. -- {Diminishing, Feigning ignorance}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. -- {Not caring, Dismissing}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir. We must. (She makes to go) -- {Dismissing, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir? -- {Dismissing, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Only with some friends, sir. -- {Evasion, Giving too brief or incomplete answers}\n[Nancy]: Oh, no, sir. Not with me. I can look after myself. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: No, sir, not always, perhaps. -- {Dismissing, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Very good, sir. It comes off easy enough. (She takes her bonnet off) There ... Is there anything more you want, sir? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Yes, sir ... (She moves to him) Is there anything you want, sir ...? -- {Dismissing, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: There! Can she do that for you? Can she do that? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: You know who I mean all right. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: She? She's a poor thing. There's no need to be jealous of her. You want to kiss me again, don't you. Don't you want to kiss me? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: There! That's better than a sick headache - ain't it? - a sick headache and a pale face all the day. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. Where? I'll meet you when you like. You're mine now - ain't you? - 'cos you want me. You want me - don't you? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Oh, yes! I always wanted you, ever since I first clapped eyes on you. I wanted you more than all of them. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Oh, yes - there's plenty of others. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Where can we meet? Where do you want us to meet? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: How'll you let me know, when she's about? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Not that I care for her. I'd like to kiss you under her very nose. That's what I'd like to do. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Go? I don't want to go. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Work? What are you going to work at? What are you going to do? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Oh, very well, sir. You shall be master for a little more. (She kisses him) Good-night, your lordship. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: (moving to the door) When shall you let me know tomorrow? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. What is it now? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. What do you want me to say? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Just like that, sir? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: With the greatest of pleasure, sir. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: She won't come. She doesn't mean to come. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: The door's locked. She's got it locked. I tried it. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: She won't let you in. I can tell by her voice. She's got it locked and she won't open it. Are you going to batter it in? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Yes. I'll do that. What are you going to write? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Yes? What? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: The dog? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: What's the game? What's the idea with the dog? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: All right. (She moves to the door) -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: (after a pause; taking the letter) What's the idea? What have you written in this? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: You're arum beggar, ain't you? (She moves to the door) Can't I look? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: She's coming. It's done the trick all right. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Go on. What's the game? What's the row about? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: (comingforward to him) All right, I'm going. (She kisses him) Good night, old dear. Give her what-for, won't you? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Ta-ta. (She heads for the door) -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Nancy]: Perhaps you will let me pass, madam. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Where is the dog? Where have you got the dog? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: You said you had the dog. Have you hurt it? Let me have it. Where is it? Have you hurt it again? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I do not want to speak to you. I am not well. I thought you had the dog and were going to hurt it. That is why I came down. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to go. You cannot keep me here. I want to go. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving DS) Yes ... Yes ... What do you want? -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to go. You cannot keep me here. I want to go. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (going to a chair other than the one indicated and which is nearer the door) Say what you have to say. -- {Dismissal, Not caring}\n\n[Mr Manningham]: I have to say that you are not sitting in the chair I indicated. Are you afraid of me that you desire to get so near the door? -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Indeed. Then you have a good deal of courage, my dear. However, will you now sit down where I told you? -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you know what you remind me of, Bella, as you walk across the room? -- {Poking at others weaknesses}\n[Mr Manningham]: Haven't you? Not that funny, glazed, dazed look of the wandering mind - the body that acts without the soul to guide it? I have often thought you had that look, but it's never been so strong as tonight. -- {Invalidation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then may I ask why you are still fully dressed? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Then will you tell me why, since you had gone to bed. you are still fully dressed? -- {Provocation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: You don't know? Do you know anything about anything you do? -- {Invalidation, Belittiling}\n[Mr Manningham]: You forgot to undress. A curious oversight, if I may say so, Bella. You know, you give me the appearance of having had a rather exciting time since I last saw you. Almost as though you have been up to something. Have you been up to something? -- {Accusations based on assumptions, Making assumptions}\n[Mr Manningham]: Am I married to a dumb woman, Bella, in addition to all else? The array of your physical and mental deficiencies is growing almost overwhelming. I advise you to answer me. -- {Invalidation, Belittiling, Making another person feel inadequate}\n[Mr Manningham]: It is not necessary for you to tell me that, Bella. I am just wondering if it might interrupt its gyratory motion for a fraction of a second, and concentrate upon the present conversation. Now please, what was it I a moment ago asked you if you remembered? -- {Patronizing, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Admirable, my dear Bella! Admirable! We shall make a great logician of you yet - a Socrates - a John Stuart Mill! You shall go down to history as the shining mind of your day. That is, if your present history does not altogether submerge you - take you away from your fellow creatures. And there is a danger of that, you know, in more ways than one. Well - what did I say I would do if you did not find that bill? -- {Patronizing, Sarcasm, Threats}\n[Mr Manningham]: Yes. And do you believe me to be a man of my word? -- {Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: You see, Bella, in a life of considerable and varied experience I have hammered out a few principles of action. In fact I actually fancy I know how to deal with my fellow men. I learned it quite early, actually - at school, in fact. There, you know, there were two ways of getting at what you wanted. One was along an intellectual plane, the other along the physical. If one failed one used the other. I took that lesson into life with me. Hitherto, with you, I have worked, with what forbearance and patience I leave you to judge, along the intellectual plane. The time has come now, I believe, to work along the other as well ... You will understand that I am a man of some power ... -- {Threats, Power games, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Why do you look at me, Bella? I said I am a man of some power and determination, and as fully capable in one direction as in the other... I will leave your imagination to work on what I mean... However, we are really digressing ... You did not find the bill I told you to find. -- {Power games, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Do you imagine you can lie to me? -- {Accusation, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Now, listen to me. Your dark, confused, rambling mind has led you into playing some pretty tricks tonight - has it not? -- {Invalidation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: Your mind is indeed tired. Your mind is so tired that it cannolongerworkatall. You do notthink. You dream. Dream all day long. Dream everything. Dream maliciously and incessantly. Don't you know that by now? You sleep-walking imbecile, what have you been dreaming tonight - where has your mind wandered - that you have split open my desk? What strange diseased dream have you had tonight - eh? -- {Invalidation, Making others feel insecure, Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: All that happened when, Bella? Tonight? Of course you dreamed all that happened - or rather all that didn't happen. -- {Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: Have I not told you ? -- {Gaslighting}\n[Mr Manningham]: (simultaneously) Sit down and be quiet. Sit down! -- {Power games, Harsh startup}\n[Mr Manningham]: (more quietly and inquisitively) What was this dream of yours, Bella? You interest me. -- {Gaslighting, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: I know you dreamed it, you gibbering wretch! I want to know more about this man of whom you dreamed. Do you hear! Do you hear me! -- {Invalidation, Power games, Harsh startup}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella. Go to your room. -- {Power games, Harsh startup}\n[Mr Manningham]: I shall find out the meaning of this, and deal with you in due course. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Mr Manningham]: Go to your room. I will call you down later. I have not finished with you yet, madam. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Rough]: Youknow, I believe you're wrong there, Manningham. I believe that is just what you have done. -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you going to explain your business, sir, or am I going to fetch a policeman and have you turned out? -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Rough]: (lighting a cigar) Ah - an admirable idea. I could have thought of nothing better myself. Yes, fetch a policeman, Manningham, and have me turned out... (Pause) Why do you wait? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Alternatively, sir, I can turn you out myself. -- {Threats, Power games}\n[Rough]: (standing and facing Mr Manningham) Yes. But why not fetch a policeman? -- {Provocation}\n[Rough]: Excuse me, Mr Manningham, but do you get the same impression as myself? -- {Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: I have noticed it. -- {Dismissal}\n\n[Rough]: Eerie, isn't it? Now we are almost in the dark... Why do you think that has happened? You don't suppose a light has been put on somewhere else ... You don't suppose that strangers have entered the house? You don't supposethereare other spirits - fellow spirits of mine - spirits surrounding this house now - spirits of justice, even, which have caught up with you at last, Mr Manningham? -- {Provocation, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Are you off your head, sir? -- {Dismissal, Belittiling}\n[Rough]: No, sir. Just an old man seeing ghosts. It must be the atmosphere of this house. (Walking about) I can see them everywhere. It's the oddest thing. Do you know one ghost I can see, Mr Manningham? You could hardly believe it. -- {Provocation, Manipulation, Poking at others weaknesses}\n[Mr Manningham]: What ghost do you see, pray? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Why, it's the ghost of an old woman, sir - the ghost of an old woman twenty years ago - an old woman who once lived in this house, who once lived in this very room. Yes - in this very room. What things I imagine! -- {Manipulation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: What are you saying? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Remarkably clear, sir, I see it... An old woman getting ready to go to bed - here in this very room - an old woman getting ready to go up to bed at the end of the day. Why! There she is. She sits just there. And now it seems I see another ghost as well. -- {Manipulation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: What's the game - eh? What's the game? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (confronting Manningham) But I still see the ghost of the man. I see him, all through the night, as he ransacks the house, hour after hour, room after room, ripping everything up. turning everything out, madly seeking the thing he cannot find. Then twenty years pass, and where is he? Why, sir, is he not still in the same house, the house he ransacked, the house he searched - and does he not now stand before the ghost of the woman he killed, in the room in which he killed her? A methodical man, apatient man, but perhaps he has waited too long. For justice has waited too, and here she is, in my person, to exact her due. And justice found, my friend, in one hour what you sought for twenty years, and still could not find. See here. Look what she found. (He moves to the bureau and picks up the bill, the letter and the brooch as he mentions them) First a bill which your wife had lost. Then a letter which never reached your wife. Then a brooch which you gave your wife but which she lost. How wicked of her! But then she didn't know its value. How was she to know that it held the Barlow Rubies. There (He opens out the brooch) See. Twelve thousand pounds' worth before your eyes! There you are, sir! You killed one woman for those and tried to drive another out of her mind. And all the time they lay in your own desk, and all they have brought you is a rope around your neck! Well, the game is over, Sydney Power, and I advise you to take the matter philosophically. -- {Accusation, Provocation, Manipulation, Making others feel insecure}\n[Mr Manningham]: You seem, sir, to have some very remarkable information. Do you imagine you are going to leave this room with such information in your possession? (He moves to the door as though to lock it) -- {Threats, Hostility}\n[Rough]: Do you imagine, sir, that you are going to leave this room without suitable escort? -- {Provocation, Manipulation}\n[Mr Manningham]: May I ask what you mean by that? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: Only that I have men in the house already. Didn't you realize that they had signalled their arrival from above, your own way in, Mr Manningham, when the light went down? -- {Manipulation, Provocation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Here you... What the devil's this? (He rushes to the door and opens it) -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Rough]: (going up to Mr Manningham) Sydney Charles Power, I have a warrant for your arrest for the murder of Alice Barlow. I should warn you that anything you may say now may be taken down in writing and used as evidence at a later date. Will you accompany us to the station in a peaceful manner? You will oblige us all, and serve your own interests best, Power, by coming with us quietly ... -- {Threats, Manipulation, Accusation}\n[Mr Manningham]: Leave go of me, will you? Here. Leave go of me! Here's a fine way of going on. Here's a fine way! -- {Dismissal, Ignoring, Victim playing}\n[Rough]: Very well - take him away ... -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Inspector Rough ... -- {No labels detected}\n[Rough]: (moving to her) Yes, my dear, now don't you think you'd better ... -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (in a weak voice) Inspector ... -- {No labels detected}\n[Rough]: Yes? -- {No labels detected}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to my husband. -- {No labels detected}\n[Rough]: Now, surely, there's nothing to be - - -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to my husband. -- {No labels detected}\n[Rough]: Very well, my dear, what do you want to say? -- {No labels detected}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I want to speak to him alone. -- {No labels detected}\n[Rough]: Alone? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, alone. Won't you please let me speak to him alone. I beg of you to allow me. I will not keep him long. -- {No labels detected}\n[Rough]: (after a pause) I don't quite understand. Alone? (Pause) Very well. You may speak to him alone. (To the men) Very well. (He signals to the men that they are to tie Mr Manningham to the chair) -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Jack! Jack! What have they done to you? What have they done? -- {No labels detected}\n[Mr Manningham]: (struggling at his bonds, half-whispering) Take it easy, Bella. You're clever. Get something to cut this and I'll get away. I can get out through the dressing-room, and make a jump for it. Can you get something? -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes, I can get something. What can I get? -- {No labels detected}\n[Mr Manningham]: There's a razor in my dressing-room. In there! Quick! Be quick! Go and get it! -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Yes. I will get it! I will get it for you. -- {No labels detected}\n[Mr Manningham]: There's a good girl. You're a good girl. Quick! Be quick! -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: How strange! The door is locked! -- {No labels detected}\n[Mr Manningham]: What do you mean - locked? There's the key, there! I see it. Tum the key, and go in! -- {Manipulation, Making another person dependent on speaker for information}\n[Mrs Manningham]: Key? What key? You are not suggesting that this is a key I hold in my hand? Have you gone mad, my husband? (She hurls the key across the room) -- {Manipulation, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: What's the game, Bella? -- {Dismissal, Ignoring}\n[Mrs Manningham]: (moving to him) Or is it I who am mad? Yes. That is it. Of course. I am mad. It was a key, and I have lost it. Dear God - I have lost it, haven't I? I am always losing things. And I can never find them. I don't know where I put them. -- {Manipulation, Making others doubt themselves}\n[Mr Manningham]: Bella ... -- {No labels detected}\n[Mrs Manningham]: I must look for it, mustn't I? Yes... If I don't find it you will lock me in my room - you will lock me in the mad-house for my mischief. Where could it be now? Could it be behind the picture? Yes, it must be there. (She goes to the picture and takes it down) No - it is not there - how strange. I must put the picture back, mustn't I? I have taken it down, and I must put it back. There. (She puts the picture back) Where now shall I look? The desk. Perhaps I put it in the desk. (She goes to the desk) No, it is not here. (She picks up the bill, the letter and the watch as she mentions them) Here is a bill. Here is a letter. Here is a watch. See. (She moves to him, the items in her hand) Take them. I have found them at last, you see! But they don't help you, do they? And I am trying to help you, aren't I? To help you to escape ... But how can a mad woman help her husband to escape? What a pity ... (Getting louder and louder) If I were not mad I could have helped you - if I were not mad, whatever you had done, I could have pitied and protected you! But because I am mad I have hated you, and because I am mad I have betrayed you, and because I am mad I am rejoicing with my heart - without a shred of pity - without a shred of regret - watching you go with glory in my heart! (She pauses, looking at him. She breathes deeply. She suddenly goes to the door UL and flings it open) Inspector! Inspector! Come and take this man away! Come and take this man away! -- {Manipulation, Making others doubt themselves, Provocation, Accusation}\n[Rough]: Now, my dear, come and sit down. Well, my child, there's all your life ahead now. It's Devonshire cream for you, and the sparkle back in your eyes. But you've had a bad time. I came in from nowhere and gave you the most horrible evening of your life, didn't I? The most horrible evening of anybody's life, I should imagine. -- {Dismissal, Ignoring, Belittiling}\n[Mrs Manningham]: The most horrible ... Oh, no ... (With a sort of proud defiance) The most wonderful... Far and away the most wonderful. -- {No labels detected}",
