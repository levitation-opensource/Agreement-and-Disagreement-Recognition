I am not telling you. Forget it.\n\nPerson B: You just said there was a problem. I am getting ready for work. Is this an emergency?? Are you okay? What\u2019s going on?\n\nPerson A: Oh, it\u2019s nothing. But call me immediately. As soon as you get on the road.\n\nPerson B: What?? Is there a problem or isn\u2019t there? Can\u2019t you just say what the issue is? If it\u2019s important, just say so.\n\nPerson A: You\u2019re not really getting ready for work, are you? Why are you texting me if you are so busy?? You\u2019re not busy. You\u2019re just avoiding me! I don\u2019t have to take your abuse. You make me feel like a piece of garbage, like nothing I have to say is important.

I bet you are texting someone else. Probably one of your many admirers\u2026I am surprised you have any time for anything else. Must feel great having all those people to talk to who stroke your ego any time you want. You know they only talk to you because they want to sleep with you, right? They are all the same, and you love it, just admit it. You love the attention. JUST SAY IT\n\nPerson B: I can\u2019t deal with this craziness today. I have a big day ahead. Can you knock it off? If you\u2019re still upset at lunch, let\u2019s chat.\n\nPerson A: I must talk to you NOW, and your day is NOT going to dictate what I get from you. You WILL CALL or you will see a very different side of me real soon.\n\nPerson B: You mean a more fun side than this? Can\u2019t wait.\n\nPerson A: THAT\u2019S IT!! YOU HAVE PISSED ME OFF FOR THE LAST TIME! MARK MY WORDS YOU WILL BE SORRY. I HAVE A MEETING NOW. GO AWAY.\n\nPerson B: OK :/\n\nPerson A: OK?!?!?!? is that all you have to say? Just okay?

  "qualitative_evaluation": "Person A's conversational style is emotionally charged, confrontational, and manipulative. They frequently use guilt-tripping and emotional blackmail to try to control the conversation and Person B's responses. They also tend to jump to conclusions and make accusations without clear evidence. \n\nPerson B, on the other hand, is more patient, calm, and rational. They try to understand the situation and ask for clarification, but also show signs of frustration and exhaustion due to Person A's behavior. They attempt to set boundaries and maintain their own emotional well-being in the face of Person A's emotional outbursts."
