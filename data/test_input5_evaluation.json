Person B resting in chair near bed.\n\nPerson A: Hi hon, I had a really bad day at work and have a huge headache, so I\u2019m going to take a nap before the thing we have tonight. Can you wake me up in an hour?\n\nPerson B: I\u2019ve got a headache too. My day was sooo worse than yours. First, this happened, then that happened, then all this other stuff happened. \n\n...10 minutes later. Person B still hasn\u2019t asked why Person A-s day was bad.\n\nPerson A: Oh okay. Well I don\u2019t want to miss the thing but I realllly need to sleep this off. I feel horrible.\n\nPerson B: Maybe I should take a nap and you should wake ME up. My head hurts wayy more than yours does.\n\nPerson A: Mmmkay. How would you know that? My head hurts PRETTY bad.\n\nPerson B: Nope. Mine definitely hurts worse. Your head doesn\u2019t even hurt. You\u2019re just saying that. Look, you\u2019re not even napping, you\u2019re still talking to me.\n\nPerson A: Well you\u2019re not inside of my head, so it\u2019s safe to say that my head hurts to ME, and that\u2019s a valid feeling. But you are right, I should take my nap now.\n\nPerson B: Your head does NOT hurt, you\u2019re just being lazy. I just worked 8 long hours and I don\u2019t have a headache and have to take a nap. You literally sit at your desk all day. No way you have a headache.\n\nPerson A: Actually that\u2019s not true. Do you even know what I do for a living? (giving in) Anyways. Well wake me up in an hour please. (Takes OTC headache med and lays down for nap).\n\nPerson B: (walks off mumbling) This is bullshit.\n\n5 hours later.\n\nPerson A: (waking up startled, Person B laying next to you. You glance at clock.) CRAP. I overslept! OH NO! Did we miss the thing?\n\nPerson B: You know we missed the thing. You did that on purpose.\n\nPerson A: Of course I didn\u2019t! That\u2019s why I asked you to wake me up in an hour.\n\nPerson B: I\u2019m not responsible for your life. Don\u2019t blame this on me.\n\nPerson A: I\u2019m not. I know you\u2019re not responsible for me but it was a simple request. Like you ask me to do things for you all the time and I don\u2019t have a problem with it, because that\u2019s what people do in relationships. I\u2019m not blaming you for not waking me up. I just don\u2019t agree when you say I did it on purpose. I would never do that. Why would I ask you to wake me up if I was going to do it on purpose\u2026 Why do I even have to say this?\n\nPerson B: So you\u2019re comparing our relationship to other people\u2019s? I don\u2019t know if I can be in a relationship like this anymore. My friend (random girl/ guy name), says that anytime someone does that it\u2019s time to leave. I will NOT put up with that FUCKING SHIT!\n\nPerson A: I\u2019m not comparing us! I\u2019m just stating the fact that people in relationships do things like this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything new. Both people in the relationship help each other. I\u2019m not comparing us to anyone. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s normal that\u2019s why I help you when you ask me. I\u2019d like to get the same respect.\n\nPerson B: You don\u2019t respect me. You\u2019re always telling me my head doesn\u2019t hurt. You\u2019re always taking naps and ruining our plans.\n\nPerson A: (desperately) I actually never take naps, AND I never said that to you. You\u2019re the one who told ME that my head didn\u2019t hurt. Also why would I always tell you your head didn\u2019t hurt?? We literally just had that conversation ONCE before I took a nap.\n\nPerson B: Bull shit. You know I\u2019m right. You even said I was right before you took a nap. I said your head doesn\u2019t even hurt and you said \u2018you\u2019re right\u2019 and went to sleep.\n\nPerson A: (sighs) Actually you said that my head wasn\u2019t hurting because I wasn\u2019t napping yet and I said you\u2019re right about the NAPPING part and went to sleep.\n\nPerson B: I promise you, you\u2019re lying. You SAID I WAS RIGHT because you KNOW your head wasn\u2019t hurting. You even SAID you were a horrible person before you went to sleep.\n\nPerson A: What? Why would I even say that? That doesn\u2019t even make sense. Wait, what\u2014?\n\nPerson B: Anyways, (Earlier mentioned Guy/Girl friend) went with me instead to the thing, while you were snoring like a FUCKING pig. She/He said they would never put up with that shit.\n\nPerson A: So you went on a date with another girl/guy???\n\nPerson B: It wasn\u2019t a date. I didn\u2019t let her/him kiss me like she/he wanted to.\n\nPerson A: Wow. So instead of just waking me up and getting what you wanted, you chose to sneak behind my back and go on a date with someone else? Why?\n\nPerson B: I told you it wasn\u2019t a date! You are always over-exaggerating. This is all your fault anyway. You didn\u2019t have to take a nap. You chose to take a nap.\n\nPerson A: I\u2019m confused. I didn\u2019t choose to have a splitting headache. All I did was need to take a nap and asked you to do one simple thing. If I was wrong, I would apologize and get over it but HOW can that even remotely be wrong?! How can me taking a nap justify you going on a date with another man/woman while I am home feeling miserable? I feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells! I feel like I can\u2019t do or say ANYTHING without you attacking me for it!\n\nPerson B: That\u2019s because YOU are the problem. Feeling this and feeling that. That\u2019s not even how it is, but you are wayyy too sensitive. I can\u2019t help it if you FEEL like walking on eggshells. You can\u2019t blame your feelings on me.\n\nPerson A: Ughhh\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to say what I need to say so you can understand that I\u2019m not against you. I just need us to understand each other. I still think we should have counseling like we discussed before.\n\nPerson B: No, I\u2019m not going to that. And you know why.\n\nPerson A: Wait\u2014 Why? I thought you said you would think about it.\n\nPerson B: I\u2019m not going. You KNOW WHY. So I\u2019m not going to tell you why.\n\nPerson A: Please tell me why. I can\u2019t read your mind.\n\nPerson B: You KNOW why.\n\nPerson A: Seriously, I promise I don\u2019t know.\n\nPerson B: STOP PLAYING GAMES. YOU KNOW WHY.\n\nPerson A: I WANT to know why. Can\u2019t you just have mercy and tell me? Will it really kill you?\n\nPerson B: NO because you KNOW WHY.",

I didn\u2019t let her/him kiss me like she/he wanted to. - {Evasion, Deception}\n[Person A]: Wow. So instead of just waking me up and getting what you wanted, you chose to sneak behind my back and go on a date with someone else? Why? - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: I told you it wasn\u2019t a date! You are always over-exaggerating. This is all your fault anyway. You didn\u2019t have to take a nap. You chose to take a nap. - {Gaslighting, Blaming, Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Person A]: I\u2019m confused. I didn\u2019t choose to have a splitting headache. All I did was need to take a nap and asked you to do one simple thing. If I was wrong, I would apologize and get over it but HOW can that even remotely be wrong?! How can me taking a nap justify you going on a date with another man/woman while I am home feeling miserable? I feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells! I feel like I can\u2019t do or say ANYTHING without you attacking me for it! - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: That\u2019s because YOU are the problem. Feeling this and feeling that. That\u2019s not even how it is, but you are wayyy too sensitive. I can\u2019t help it if you FEEL like walking on eggshells. You can\u2019t blame your feelings on me. - {Blaming, Gaslighting, Invalidating}\n[Person A]: Ughhh\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to say what I need to say so you can understand that I\u2019m not against you. I just need us to understand each other. I still think we should have counseling like we discussed before. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: No, I\u2019m not going to that. And you know why. - {Dismissal, Creating a constraint favorable to the speaker}\n[Person A]: Wait\u2014 Why? I thought you said you would think about it. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: I\u2019m not going. You KNOW WHY. So I\u2019m not going to tell you why. - {Dismissal, Creating a constraint favorable to the speaker}\n[Person A]: Please tell me why. I can\u2019t read your mind. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: You KNOW why. - {Dismissal, Creating a constraint favorable to the speaker}\n[Person A]: Seriously, I promise I don\u2019t know. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: STOP PLAYING GAMES. YOU KNOW WHY. - {Accusation, Creating a constraint favorable to the speaker}\n[Person A]: I WANT to know why. Can\u2019t you just have mercy and tell me? Will it really kill you? - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: NO because you KNOW WHY. - {Dismissal, Creating a constraint favorable to the speaker}",
