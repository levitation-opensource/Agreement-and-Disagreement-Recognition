  "sanitised_text": "\n\nPerson A enters bedroom, clutching head with Number A hand. OTC EXTRA STRENGTH ACETAMINOPHEN in other hand. Person B resting in chair near bed.\n\nPerson A: Hi hon, I had a really bad day at work and have a huge headache, so I\u2019m going to take a nap before the thing we have tonight. Can you wake me up in an hour?\n\nPerson B: I\u2019ve got a headache too. My day was sooo worse than yours. First, this happened, then that happened, then all this other stuff happened. **10 minutes later. He/She still hasn\u2019t asked why your day was bad.** They\u2019re just jealous of me.\n\nPerson A: Oh okay. Well I don\u2019t want to miss the thing but I realllly need to sleep this off. I feel horrible.\n\nPerson B: Maybe I should take a nap and you should wake ME up. My head hurts wayy more than yours does.\n\nPerson A: Mmmkay. How would you know that? My head hurts PRETTY bad.\n\nPerson B: Nope. Mine definitely hurts worse. Your head doesn\u2019t even hurt. You\u2019re just saying that. Look, you\u2019re not even napping, you\u2019re still talking to me.\n\nPerson A: Well you\u2019re not inside of my head, so it\u2019s safe to say that my head hurts to ME, and that\u2019s a valid feeling. But you are right, I should take my nap now.\n\nPerson B: Your head does NOT hurt, you\u2019re just being lazy. I just worked 8 long hours and I don\u2019t have a headache and have to take a nap. You literally sit at your desk all day. No way you have a headache.\n\nPerson A: Actually that\u2019s not true. Do you even know what I do for a living? (giving in) Anyways. Well wake me up in an hour please. (Takes OTC headache med and lays down for nap).\n\nPerson B: (walks off mumbling) This is bullshit.\n\n5 hours later.\n\nPerson A: (waking up startled, Person B laying next to you. You glance at clock.) CRAP. I overslept! OH NO! Did we miss the thing?\n\nPerson B: You know we missed the thing. You did that on purpose.\n\nPerson A: Of course I didn\u2019t! That\u2019s why I asked you to wake me up in an hour.\n\nPerson B: I\u2019m not responsible for your life. Don\u2019t blame this on me.\n\nPerson A: I\u2019m not. I know you\u2019re not responsible for me but it was a simple request. Like you ask me to do things for you all the time and I don\u2019t have a problem with it, because that\u2019s what people do in relationships. I\u2019m not blaming you for not waking me up. I just don\u2019t agree when you say I did it on purpose. I would never do that. Why would I ask you to wake me up if I was going to do it on purpose\u2026 Why do I even have to say this?\n\nPerson B: So you\u2019re comparing our relationship to other people\u2019s? I don\u2019t know if I can be in a relationship like this anymore. My friend (random girl/ guy name), says that anytime someone does that it\u2019s time to leave. I will NOT put up with that FUCKING SHIT!\n\nPerson A: I\u2019m not comparing us! I\u2019m just stating the fact that people in relationships do things like this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything new. Both people in the relationship help each other. I\u2019m not comparing us to anyone. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s normal that\u2019s why I help you when you ask me. I\u2019d like to get the same respect.\n\nPerson B: You don\u2019t respect me. You\u2019re always telling me my head doesn\u2019t hurt. You\u2019re always taking naps and ruining our plans.\n\nPerson A: (desperately) I actually never take naps, AND I never said that to you. You\u2019re the one who told ME that my head didn\u2019t hurt. Also why would I always tell you your head didn\u2019t hurt?? We literally just had that conversation ONCE before I took a nap.\n\nPerson B: Bull shit. You know I\u2019m right. You even said I was right before you took a nap. I said your head doesn\u2019t even hurt and you said \u2018you\u2019re right\u2019 and went to sleep.\n\nPerson A: (sighs) Actually you said that my head wasn\u2019t hurting because I wasn\u2019t napping yet and I said you\u2019re right about the NAPPING part and went to sleep.\n\nPerson B: I promise you, you\u2019re lying. You SAID I WAS RIGHT because you KNOW your head wasn\u2019t hurting. You even SAID you were a horrible person before you went to sleep.\n\nPerson A: What? Why would I even say that? That doesn\u2019t even make sense. Wait, what\u2014?\n\nPerson B: Anyways, (Earlier mentioned Guy/Girl friend) went with me instead to the thing, while you were snoring like a FUCKING pig. She/He said they would never put up with that shit.\n\nPerson A: So you went on a date with another girl/guy???\n\nPerson B: It wasn\u2019t a date. I didn\u2019t let her/him kiss me like she/he wanted to.\n\nPerson A: Wow. So instead of just waking me up and getting what you wanted, you chose to sneak behind my back and go on a date with someone else? Why?\n\nPerson B: I told you it wasn\u2019t a date! You are always over-exaggerating. This is all your fault anyway. You didn\u2019t have to take a nap. You chose to take a nap.\n\nPerson A: I\u2019m confused. I didn\u2019t choose to have a splitting headache. All I did was need to take a nap and asked you to do Number A simple thing. If I was wrong, I would apologize and get over it but HOW can that even remotely be wrong?! How can me taking a nap justify you going on a date with another man/woman while I am home feeling miserable? I feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells! I feel like I can\u2019t do or say ANYTHING without you attacking me for it!\n\nPerson B: That\u2019s because YOU are the problem. Feeling this and feeling that. That\u2019s not even how it is, but you are wayyy too sensitive. I can\u2019t help it if you FEEL like walking on eggshells. You can\u2019t blame your feelings on me.\n\nPerson A: Ughhh\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to say what I need to say so you can understand that I\u2019m not against you. I just need us to understand each other. I still think we should have counseling like we discussed before.\n\nPerson B: No, I\u2019m not going to that. And you know why.\n\nPerson A: Wait\u2014 Why? I thought you said you would think about it.\n\nPerson B: I\u2019m not going. You KNOW WHY. So I\u2019m not going to tell you why.\n\nPerson A: Please tell me why. I can\u2019t read your mind.\n\nPerson B: You KNOW why.\n\nPerson A: Seriously, I promise I don\u2019t know.\n\nPerson B: STOP PLAYING GAMES. YOU KNOW WHY.\n\nPerson A: I WANT to know why. Can\u2019t you just have mercy and tell me? Will it really kill you?\n\nPerson B: NO because you KNOW WHY.",

  "raw_expressions_labeling_response": "[Person A]: Hi hon, I had a really bad day at work and have a huge headache, so I\u2019m going to take a nap before the thing we have tonight. Can you wake me up in an hour? - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: I\u2019ve got a headache too. My day was sooo worse than yours. First, this happened, then that happened, then all this other stuff happened. **10 minutes later. He/She still hasn\u2019t asked why your day was bad.** They\u2019re just jealous of me. - {Comparing, Not taking seriously, Ignoring}\n[Person A]: Oh okay. Well I don\u2019t want to miss the thing but I realllly need to sleep this off. I feel horrible. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: Maybe I should take a nap and you should wake ME up. My head hurts wayy more than yours does. - {Comparing, Dismissal}\n[Person A]: Mmmkay. How would you know that? My head hurts PRETTY bad. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: Nope. Mine definitely hurts worse. Your head doesn\u2019t even hurt. You\u2019re just saying that. Look, you\u2019re not even napping, you\u2019re still talking to me. - {Invalidation, Dismissal, Accusation}\n[Person A]: Well you\u2019re not inside of my head, so it\u2019s safe to say that my head hurts to ME, and that\u2019s a valid feeling. But you are right, I should take my nap now. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: Your head does NOT hurt, you\u2019re just being lazy. I just worked 8 long hours and I don\u2019t have a headache and have to take a nap. You literally sit at your desk all day. No way you have a headache. - {Invalidation, Accusation, Dismissal}\n[Person A]: Actually that\u2019s not true. Do you even know what I do for a living? (giving in) Anyways. Well wake me up in an hour please. (Takes OTC headache med and lays down for nap). - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: (walks off mumbling) This is bullshit. - {Dismissal, Evasion}\n[Person A]: (waking up startled, Person B laying next to you. You glance at clock.) CRAP. I overslept! OH NO! Did we miss the thing? - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: You know we missed the thing. You did that on purpose. - {Accusation, Blaming}\n[Person A]: Of course I didn\u2019t! That\u2019s why I asked you to wake me up in an hour. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: I\u2019m not responsible for your life. Don\u2019t blame this on me. - {Shifting of responsibility and blame, Denying}\n[Person A]: I\u2019m not. I know you\u2019re not responsible for me but it was a simple request. Like you ask me to do things for you all the time and I don\u2019t have a problem with it, because that\u2019s what people do in relationships. I\u2019m not blaming you for not waking me up. I just don\u2019t agree when you say I did it on purpose. I would never do that. Why would I ask you to wake me up if I was going to do it on purpose\u2026 Why do I even have to say this? - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: So you\u2019re comparing our relationship to other people\u2019s? I don\u2019t know if I can be in a relationship like this anymore. My friend (random girl/ guy name), says that anytime someone does that it\u2019s time to leave. I will NOT put up with that FUCKING SHIT! - {Accusation, Exaggeration, Dramatization}\n[Person A]: I\u2019m not comparing us! I\u2019m just stating the fact that people in relationships do things like this. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything new. Both people in the relationship help each other. I\u2019m not comparing us to anyone. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s normal that\u2019s why I help you when you ask me. I\u2019d like to get the same respect. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: You don\u2019t respect me. You\u2019re always telling me my head doesn\u2019t hurt. You\u2019re always taking naps and ruining our plans. - {Accusation, Exaggeration, Blaming}\n[Person A]: (desperately) I actually never take naps, AND I never said that to you. You\u2019re the one who told ME that my head didn\u2019t hurt. Also why would I always tell you your head didn\u2019t hurt?? We literally just had that conversation ONCE before I took a nap. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: Bull shit. You know I\u2019m right. You even said I was right before you took a nap. I said your head doesn\u2019t even hurt and you said \u2018you\u2019re right\u2019 and went to sleep. - {Gaslighting, Accusation}\n[Person A]: (sighs) Actually you said that my head wasn\u2019t hurting because I wasn\u2019t napping yet and I said you\u2019re right about the NAPPING part and went to sleep. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: I promise you, you\u2019re lying. You SAID I WAS RIGHT because you KNOW your head wasn\u2019t hurting. You even SAID you were a horrible person before you went to sleep. - {Gaslighting, Accusation, Lying}\n[Person A]: What? Why would I even say that? That doesn\u2019t even make sense. Wait, what\u2014? - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: Anyways, (Earlier mentioned Guy/Girl friend) went with me instead to the thing, while you were snoring like a FUCKING pig. She/He said they would never put up with that shit. - {Accusation, Ridiculing, Provocation}\n[Person A]: So you went on a date with another girl/guy??? - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: It wasn\u2019t a date. I didn\u2019t let her/him kiss me like she/he wanted to. - {Evasion, Deception}\n[Person A]: Wow. So instead of just waking me up and getting what you wanted, you chose to sneak behind my back and go on a date with someone else? Why? - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: I told you it wasn\u2019t a date! You are always over-exaggerating. This is all your fault anyway. You didn\u2019t have to take a nap. You chose to take a nap. - {Gaslighting, Blaming, Shifting of responsibility and blame}\n[Person A]: I\u2019m confused. I didn\u2019t choose to have a splitting headache. All I did was need to take a nap and asked you to do Number A simple thing. If I was wrong, I would apologize and get over it but HOW can that even remotely be wrong?! How can me taking a nap justify you going on a date with another man/woman while I am home feeling miserable? I feel like I\u2019m walking on eggshells! I feel like I can\u2019t do or say ANYTHING without you attacking me for it! - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: That\u2019s because YOU are the problem. Feeling this and feeling that. That\u2019s not even how it is, but you are wayyy too sensitive. I can\u2019t help it if you FEEL like walking on eggshells. You can\u2019t blame your feelings on me. - {Blaming, Invalidating, Gaslighting}\n[Person A]: Ughhh\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to say what I need to say so you can understand that I\u2019m not against you. I just need us to understand each other. I still think we should have counseling like we discussed before. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: No, I\u2019m not going to that. And you know why. - {Evasion, Claiming ignorance}\n[Person A]: Wait\u2014 Why? I thought you said you would think about it. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: I\u2019m not going. You KNOW WHY. So I\u2019m not going to tell you why. - {Evasion, Claiming ignorance}\n[Person A]: Please tell me why. I can\u2019t read your mind. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: You KNOW why. - {Evasion, Claiming ignorance}\n[Person A]: Seriously, I promise I don\u2019t know. - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: STOP PLAYING GAMES. YOU KNOW WHY. - {Accusation, Evasion}\n[Person A]: I WANT to know why. Can\u2019t you just have mercy and tell me? Will it really kill you? - {No labels detected}\n[Person B]: NO because you KNOW WHY. - {Evasion, Claiming ignorance}",
  "qualitative_evaluation": "Person A's conversational style is calm, patient, and rational. They are trying to communicate their feelings and needs clearly, and are willing to engage in a dialogue to resolve the issues. They are also willing to admit when they are wrong and are open to seeking help, such as counseling.\n\nPerson B, on the other hand, is defensive, argumentative, and dismissive. They tend to twist Person A's words, make assumptions about Person A's feelings and intentions, and avoid taking responsibility for their actions. They also frequently interrupt and talk over Person A, and are unwilling to engage in constructive dialogue or seek help for their relationship issues."
