It will only take a half hour.\n\nPerson A: Wait you want me to drop what I am doing, so I can pick up you and Lula up, so you can drop me off back at my place?? That will take a minimum of at an hour and a half.\n\nPerson B: Exactly!! What's the big deal.\n\nPerson A: What are you and Lula doing tonight?\n\nPerson B: Well it's Friday night so we are going to go out.\n\nPerson A: What do you guys have planned?\n\nPerson B: (evasively): Umm, I don't have to get into that with you?\n\nPerson A: What?\n\nPerson B: Come on what does it matter, we are just going to go out clubbing!\n\nPerson A: You know it's getting kind of late, maybe tonight is not a good night.\n\nPerson B: (impatiently and angrily): Ohhh come on!! I can't believe how selfish you are being!\n\nPerson A: (mildly amused by the overt projection): I just told you I need to get work done because I spent the first part of the week helping you move into your new apartment. You ask to use my car and then when I ask what you need my car for, you don't want to tell me.....then.....\n\nPerson B: Okay, alright, Lula and I are going to meet Chip and Rod at the Mongoose Room; it's \"buck a beer night.\"\n\nPerson A: Who are Rod and Chip???\n\nPerson B: Just these two Australian guys who Lula waited on last night when she was at work.\n\nPerson A: Remember, how we were talking the other night about trying to avoid putting yourself in compromising situations??\n\nPerson B: (combatively):Ohhh, no you don't!\n\nPerson A: Ohhh, no I don't what??\n\nPerson B: (angrily): I don't want talk about whatever it is you want talk about. I am not going to rehash!! The past is past. Now is now. I need to know if you will lend me your car right now.\n\nPerson A: You told me that you value what you and I have together. If that's the case, I think this is something we should talk about....\n\nPerson B: (explosively): I knew it!!! I KNEW IT!!!\n\nPerson A: What did you know??\n\nPerson B: (rapidly and angrily): Here comes the control!!! I will not be controlled!! I am a free bird!! I need to be free!!\n\nPerson A: Ok fair enough, .....it obvious you think my merely asking you to use good judgement constitutes my controlling you.\n\nPerson B: Yes, it's not fair!! You are wrong! I need your car.....\n\nPerson A: Why don't you have Chad and Skip drive you guys.......\n\nPerson B: First of all, its Rod and Chip. Second, we already asked them, that's why I called you!!!!\n\nPerson A: Your are kidding me, right?\n\nPerson B: Kidding....kidding you about what?\n\nPerson A: If you had not called me to borrow my car tonight, would you have even mentioned that you and Lula were meeting two guys on a Friday night for drinks?\n\nPerson B: What does that have to do with anything? Why does that even matter??\n\nPerson A: It matters for a few reasons. First, you and I had agreed that we would treat one another the way we would want to be treated.\n\nPerson B: (crankily): Oh my God! No, no, no....I am not to be controlled!!\n\nPerson A: (calmly): No worries, I have no interest in controlling you. I understand where you coming from. You are a free bird.\n\nPerson B: That's right, I need to be free just to be me. I just want to spread my wings and zoom here, there, and everywhere!! But of course I need you to be my guide and take care of me.\n\nPerson A: (Steadily and non-confrontationally): Hey let me run something by you.\n\nPerson B: (suspiciously) Yeah...what?\n\nPerson A: Remember how the other day we had agreed that before we do something or take action, we would try think about how the other person would feel if our roles were reversed, right?\n\nPerson B: (evasively): Hmmmmm. yeah\u2026so? What are you saying?? What does that have to do with anything?\n\nPerson A: I can see how this discussion is going to play out already....we are going to get caught in a loop.....\n\nPerson B: What that supposed to mean?\n\nPerson B: What that means is you are going to go into hyper evasion mode, and you have no interest in living up to your word.... You want, what you want, when you want it, and there is no getting around that....\n\nPerson B: I literally have no idea what you are talking about!!\n\nPerson A: (deep sigh): Ok, let me explain what I mean through examples. Do you remember what happed at Costco just yesterday which resulted in your going ballistic?!?\n\nPerson B: (defensively and angrily) That was different...wait\u2026..what does that have to do with anything?\n\nPerson A: Let's just try to work through this...just yesterday, did you not have a virtual full-on-fit when we were at the checkout counter at Costco?\n\nPerson B: (irate): That was not the same. You were wrong!! What you did was full on wrong and you know it!!!!\n\nPerson A: What exactly did I do as the cashier was handing me my change that was \"full on wrong?\"\n\nPerson B: You are not Mr. Innocent... you flirted!! You flirted, and I could tell. After all, why was she smiling at you!! You were flir.........\n\nPerson A: (interrupting): Let me just make one point so that I can come full circle with all this...I want you to think about something.\n\nPerson B: (shouting angrily): What?!?!?\n\nPerson A: (patiently): If my merely checking out at the COSTCO sales counter resulted in your getting jealous, how would you feel if Paul and I went to The Armadillo Club tonight to meet Lana and Nicole, two Hawaiian women, who Paul met when he waited on their table last night. I need to also mention that it's Friday night therefore the Armadillo Club is having buy one get one free mixed drinks night.\n\nPerson B: (silence...then abruptly): Hey did you hear about that Trump thing!!\n\nPerson A: Trump thing.... are you going to ignore what we were just talking about?\n\nPerson B: (angrily): Look are you going to pick me and Lula up or not?\n\nPerson A: Are going to ignore the topic we were just talking about??\n\nPerson B: I gotta goooo.....seeeyah....(click)\n\nPerson A: astounded, bewildered, annoyed, confused........",
