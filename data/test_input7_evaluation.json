They're meeting up with an old friend at her home for pictures \u2014 she's a professional now and offered to do some Mommy-Daughter shots for Person B.\n\nAs Person A is preparing to leave, Person A stops Person B to \"remind them\" to feed their daughter. Person B replies that she's already had her morning meal and Person B has packed cereal for her as a snack for the short trip.\n\nPerson A: \"You should really give her some of this breakfast I just cooked.\"\n\nPerson B: \"Really, mom, it's fine. She JUST ate and we're running late. We have to go.\" I say as I prepare a small diaper bag.\n\nPerson A: \"Person B, your baby needs nutrients and protein. Here's some for her.\" She places a plate out with the food which Person B ignores as Person B places her little one in her carseat.\n\nPerson B does't respond to Person A, knowing NOTHING Person B say won't spiral out of control.\n\nAs Person B is about to leave, it's announced again that Person B is FORGETTING HER BREAKFAST.\n\nPerson B: \"I have to leave now or we'll be late. Like I've said, she's ALREADY eaten.\"\n\nPerson A: \"But this is so much better for her. Are you really going to deprive your little one of food BECAUSE YOU'RE RUNNING LATE?\" (Don't forget, the statement is dripping with disgust based on her tone.)\n\nPerson B: Calmly responds, despite the steady rush of frustration and blood starting to show in their face: \"It's Thanksgiving, she already ate. There's no reason to be late just because you want her to have a second breakfast within the hour of the first one. It doesn't benefit her. I have to go now. Have a great day.\"\n\nBefore Person B closes the door: \n\nPerson A: \"You're a horrible mother who apparently can't even take a moment to feed their own child. I feel sorry for your daughter.\"",

  "qualitative_evaluation": "Person A has a persistent and somewhat confrontational style, repeatedly insisting that Person B feed their daughter the breakfast they've prepared, despite being told that the child has already eaten. They use guilt and emotional manipulation, implying that Person B is a bad mother for not accepting their advice. \n\nPerson B, on the other hand, maintains a calm and patient conversational style, despite the increasing frustration. They repeatedly explain their situation and reasoning, trying to avoid conflict. However, they also show assertiveness by sticking to their decision and not giving in to Person A's pressure."
