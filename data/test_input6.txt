Bob, is married to Sue. Sue cooked him dinner and was up till midnight waiting for Bob to come home. His cell was turned off and her increasingly desperate messages went right to voicemail and her texts were never answered.

Bob missed dinner because he went out for drinks with some male colleagues after work and they ended up at a strip club, They all got very drunk and had lap dances.

He came home very drunk with his clothing disheveled and in no condition to answer any of Sue’s questions coherently.

The next morning, Sue asks Bob to explain why he missed dinner and didn’t answer her texts. Bob becomes extremely defensive and tries to side step her questions.

Bob: Please leave me alone. My head hurts.

Sue: Well, you shouldn’t have been drinking! I was waiting at home for you. I made dinner. I deserve an explanation. What were you doing that was so important that you couldn’t let me know?

Bob: Look, let’s talk about it some other time.

Sue: You owe me an explanation. I need some clarity about why you came home drunk with your shirt half open.

Bob: I work hard all day. Aren’t I entitled to relax and have a drink after work?

Sue: But what about me? You knew I was home waiting for you. How could you be so thoughtless and cruel?

Bob: Shut up b*tch!
