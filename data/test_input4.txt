Alex: peels a hardboiled egg and throws the shell on the floor.

Lee: uh… hey, the garbage is right over here.

Alex: are you saying I'm lazy?

Lee: what? No. But I'd appreciate it if you didn't throw garbage on my floor.

Alex: So you're saying it's my fault that your apartment is messy?

Lee: Uh… no. It is your fault there are egg shells on my floor.

Alex: Look, your place isn't immaculate. When I was in the bathroom, I saw some toothpaste spatter in the sink. That wasn't my fault. That was YOUR fault.

Lee: *sighs and picks up the eggshell*

Alex: Now you're trying to make me feel bad.

Lee: I just don't want eggshells on my floor.

Alex: So you care more about eggshells than you care about me.

Lee: Look. The garbage is only a metre away from you. It seems like it'd be easier for you to just throw it out than for me to pick it up.

Alex: Now you're trying to make me feel bad. You're just like my father, and you know how terrible he was to me.

Lee: OK, you're obviously upset about something. What can I do?

Alex: Well an apology would be a good start.

Lee: Alright. I'm sorry.

Alex: What are you sorry for?

Lee: I'm… sorry that you're so upset that you threw garbage on my floor.

Alex: There you go, making this my fault again.

Lee: Well what am I supposed to be apologizing for?

Alex: You should apologize for making me feel bad.

Lee: I'm sorry I've made you feel bad.

Alex: There. Holy Christ, was that so hard? *throws another eggshell on the floor*
